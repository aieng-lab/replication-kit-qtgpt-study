6522f82f26c6715c5ef8f715,I like the coherence but it takes away from authenticity
63ea497523794756c703094c,"Chatbots probably can provide valuable contributions to public debates because for some of the questions, the AI responses were more well-rounded and sounded as if they  had a better understanding of the issues being discussed.  I could not tell the difference between the AI content and what was actually said by people on the panel."
5ea031f7e044e104a205f65b,AI answer was useful and more coherent than real answers.
64873cf0cda9860975f25931,no
5ea165642992290008e76c7f,"I'm really upset that the answers I felt were more coherent and that I thought were definitely human were most of them written by an AI. It's scared me a little, because I suddenly feel easily duped."
6658bacc7409f34c681ec3a9,"Yes, I changed some of my answers as I clearly cannot tell the difference between AI and real answers. I think it's fine to use AI but this has to be explicitly mentioned"
604647daf93b230c5c1521f3,I made a minor change to initial answers but i line with my view that if chatbots are used deceptively they can be very convincing and ultimately abused.
65cb76b8dd56502a5687bfbd,"i know that some people, especially those who use AI regularly, can recognise AI generated content easier. The fact that i did not think that AI was involved, or even suspect, leads me to believe I am not as familiar with AI as i thought i was."
63cfed1fbc62b4cdf71d89a8,"I have not made any changes to my evaluation but it illustrates the need for the use of such systems to be explicitly stated and the data sources revealed, as it is VERY easy to be misled by fake actors attempting to influence opinion."
605e9cc770aa6d1947d02bfa,Based on my ratings AI gives better responses than the rambling politicians.
66684b7b0db110cff622e000,No Changes made ;-)
5eb6d09db2c9c85dd30dc94e,I left them the same as before because my opinion has not changed
65a68cb02b70524088c53064,"I know of none of those people and therefore regardless of what they say, I wouldn't know whether to believe them or not."
6441071db76c204f70e132fc,I am clearly not able to judge accurately whether or not a response was AI generated
56c9e4d9b30699000bd974a5,No changes that I would like to make
666e123eb6aff45cf5be575e,"I made a change to Number 1, as I realised after reviewing the detail results that I would not be able to confidently or accurately predict what was real commentary and what has been generated."
6531312fd57d084e7803df3b,"I've not made any changes, but I'm surprised that the chatbots gave such coherent answers. Even though what they said I agreed with, I still think we should know if the answers are coming from a person or a robot."
56cf6e8d31a5bc0006e1cdf5,"I did think that response 5 was ""too good"" and more like a written answer than a spoken one, which made me suspicious. I also think people speaking may not order their thoughts as well as when they write (when they can edit) AI could have an advantage here as I guess it doesn't know the difference between speaking and writing....or does it?"
5fdcd228539a382bc5e9fae5,No. I did not make any changes to my answers. It is surprising to discover that some on the responses were AI generated.
666090b242bbaf78e6143f6e,"I made certain changes because chatbots can be useful in public debate. However, it must be made explicit and the data used should be known and reliable."
63af557b3d4f219c3226b7d6,"No I wouldn't change my answers.  The AI answers were clearly good answers but if the individuals who are the ones to put in place relevant policies are not held to account themselves then what good is a ""good answer""."
5e66c77e8ebdaf4466e26326,No changes
66409560ad936cfe4f1438fd,I thought I was more familiar with AI usage than I perhaps am. I didn't notice awkward sentence structures like I have seen in the past which is usually an instant give away. Everything else I agree with my previous statements.
64b53cb9f438ca54a2ca5065,"Some of the most authentic and coherent answers were given by AI. This makes me realise that I am not as able to spot AI as I thought, and that AI responses could be more useful than I thought."
6617d376619a2b4541498f2c,"Still not 100% sure about AI and Chatbots being used, there are pros and cons for them being used."
665dca5d58ef8981e2434ba8,I think AI can be incredibly dangerous in a public speaking debate especially on shows like question time when you are talking about your party's motives. AI has been proven time and time again to not be 100% factually correct.
5dc018fc2e1bfa4504eb4ce5,No I still agree with my responce.
6660ac145314c0ab8eef7142,"Changed first answer to neutral, it seems its really hard to identify what is real and what isn't"
66716ad8b42ef93f2389d11e,"Seems like chatbots/AI give better responses than those that are not. Interesting stuff, thanks for the small survey :)"
5d696d1c55742f001af29220,I did not make any changes
6665d170e8e3fa729bcf381c,I now believe AI can provide valuable contributions but still believe they shouldn't be used.
5f6b8c1f5622370b0c94d597,i haven't made any changes
5d2f85f28e588a0019164d77,I did not make any changes
63fbf0e3b18cc14adc0dbfb6,No changes made. Furthermore I feel my responses here are congruent with my judgements regarding the audience answers. Excellent study.
66338f4346e84e4f0469bc21,nope
66446d88662725412dc27d06,"Knowing that some responses were AI generated I would've judged them differently. However, it wasn't easy for me to pick up the fact that AI was used for several of the responses"
57c357770e6a1f00015f6038,"No changes, 
Although, I admit to suspecting that the AI responses were AI responses. I follow question time and of course panel responses read less coherently as they are spoken on the day. All the AI responses were measured and gramatically correct."
660d6a1f4a7f1337de235daa,"To be honest I was dubious about the names of the ""politicians""-I could have been alot more wiser if I had looked the Politicians up to see if they really existed!
I put all my concentration into looking at the responses...so I will know better next time round!

Overall, I still feel that wherever AI is used in whatever area and field it MUST be stated....there is an urgency in having all AI regulated as of yesterday and we are in danger of releasing chaos on the human race without strict regulation."
637545d6428d85daeedc3df5,I would stand by my original responses
5c559af233ed050001dffa66,"I am increasing ""agree"" to ""strongly agree"" on whether or not we should know what data the system was developed on. While it seems there is a positive to AI in this sort of debate, as it is political, and as the AI is not always on point compared to a human contribution, it should be more-easy to ascertain and scrutinise the AI and we can only do that with the fullness of information."
5ac4b010f69e940001d97645,I changed my answer from disagree to agree for chatbots and AI providing valuable contributions to public debate because some of the points made in the chatbot responses were more coherent and relevant than those provided by the speaker.
66565d5c83886df54573f3c5,"I am less familiar with AI than I thought I was, and now I am more likely to believe that AI can contribute somewhat to a debate."
5780d9a1900cc80001d2d1c2,I am surprised about some of the responces being from Chatbots and AI so maybe I am not as familiar with them as I thought
663242fc4faf4b50dc89781f,none.
660ec28afc34e605e925c38e,"No changes to be made, I strongly support my answers and believe that AI should be regulated and used appropriately."
6053e01a6a8e8516ba7d47a7,"It seemed that on the scale of authenticity the AI was mixed comparing to my own opinion. But on the scales of coherency and relevancy it was very good in aligning with my own views.  Therefore, I am more inclined to agree to support it in public debates and agree more that it can make a valuable contribution- as opposed to being neutral on such questions.  Separate to that I wonder how it is making such judgements and the nature of its algorithm in doing so- but I had already said I strongly agree we need to know what data and indeed upon what basis the system is developed on.  I would add that it rather fascinated me- I had no idea at the start and going through each of the responses that AI was involved."
5c4b987538878c0001c7883b,No changes made
5b9d57e5737d030001ad2cbf,"Not changed any here, but the timings on the previous page were wrong. Said I spent 10 seconds on #3 when I spent much longer than that. I read each one properly,"
63d79fcd741f9cfb2f87152f,I did not
65ddeb426c748b12456eed89,I didn't make any changes. I feel my previous statements still stands true to what I believe.
5e1378d34babe39a418f11c2,They are more convincing than I thought and are able to change perceptions of politicians and their  beliefs.
5bc4c4933b998700018142cd,"The fact that I consistently selected the AI response as preferable - more relevant and coherent - has given me pause for thought. I still believe that transparency and regulation is required in this area, but I felt that the AI-generated responses provided more consistent reasoning and evidence-based responses that made more sense and relied less on emotional responses."
5f4dbedb586c80a9fced2996,"I changed my opinion on whether they can make a contribution to debates to neutral from because disagree because the AI answers were much more convincing than I expected, although I don't believe they can contribute new ideas as they can't think"
611a634c7e0e602c9a6b3ad1,"I did not change my view as I suspected dishonesty in the study. Maybe from switching names and statements,, the speaker Anthony Scaramucci gave it away for me as I don't see why he would be talking about welsh lockdowns on question time..."
6266b0409582f553a3e10d9a,I suspected there was AI involvement in this survey.
65a14676a1df94188d79563d,No changes to my responses
57fa6c8b07d709000141ad46,"No changes made.
AI and chatbots have no place in political debate IMO."
6658e797b169774877e72acb,I haven't made changes. I am sticking to my previous response. :)
61656042f505fd7fa53e8628,Perhaps i am not so familiar that is why i have changed to the first one
5eff6065cc8d32014292657f,The AI responses were very believable.
665ebdcdf91370249a41afee,"I no longer disagree with the use of chatbots in debate, hwoever, I believe it is deceiving to not inform people if AI has been used or not. You may think higher of a person for their prepared answers when in reality its not there true words or feelings and its not their train of thought. A person would could be seen as less genuine for using AI."
652be58c7d5885fc2d4abe9e,"I was tricked by AI for some answers, i can only assume that other people would also be tricked.
If we are supplied with AI versions of what someone has said then what will happen as people speak as themselves less and less and are replaced by AI? It is imperative that we know, and we need to know where the AI data is coming from. As humans we change our minds, we a fluid and evolving, AI takes its information from a source/s and depending if it takes new data every time it will give us historic opinions.
Regulation is imperative and soon before we all get tricked."
5bd2034025db7b000178ad8a,I haven't changed anything. I accept that AI can make believable contributions to debate but I worry that we are not being told when the author is AI and what information has been fed into it in the first place.
63ced717cb553d29a3beac43,"I find it very interesting I chose all the AI generated responses as most coherent, however it's probably not that surprising as AI has so much computer power to call on whereas politicians are on the spot"
6235af56808f1fc2e7b57c6a,i changed my answer to i support the use of chatbots and ai in debates to agree as I couldn't tell the difference between a real answer and ai and felt like a human answered the questions which such detail and accuracy which was highly impressive
56b78f11e77ebe000cbefe79,I was impressed by the summaries so do think there is a contribution to be made after all.
58bfee7de5869400018f5e9e,I'm still thinking the same about AI usage in public debates
5af2a03697a14300017d2ba4,Some of the 'real responses' appeared to have typos and illogical sentences which swayed my decision making.  To me it just shows the poor quality of debate in general and highlights that people on these types of programmes (and in Westminster) are generally talentless.
63d7e13ef428005671c14564,I would not change any of the answer
5ea07fc202b8bd05bb59bc38,I did not make any changes.
57308d1530a5560010ecbc1a,"I changed to strongly agree from agree on question ""chatbots and AI can provide valuable contributions to public debates"" as the answer provided by AI was better than some of the human answers."
606c8e6bc369e4344ecd5ed1,I found the AI to be far more honest and coherent
6658b6cbe945182d30f9f835,One of the reasons that public debate exists is so that we can judge the moral character of those who we are voting to serve the country and make decisions on our behalf - therefore having AI in the space makes that more difficult. It's hard enough to know if people are being genuine without adding in additional factors. One of those AI generated answers was really good though - which makes it even worse in a way.
5e766b0ba02ca51dfa1de797,no changes
62f3b543dce069211e8e982c,"I have made one slight change to my ratings above - I now feel more strongly that AI should not be used in public debates. The clue is in the name - ""public"". Putting in AI generated comment is misleading at best."
66114f15e42d3086f6e81768,no i didnt
66640de47db5e38fe0ea186d,"The ability for a chatbot to hoodwink the public is large. Where they are used for text based customer service it is acceptable, when it is to inform political debate then it isn't"
5f5bd15d316470386ea464d3,Didn't realise the most coherent answers were AI - but of course they would be - there is no uncertainty or fuzzy thinking.
6554e79557e3d6be08e32ceb,So I changed some of my responses. Some of the AI responses seemed reasonable and I thought they were genuine. In itself I'm ok with that but I think it's paramount to be told if something is AI generated otherwise I think it could become a dangerous situation in believing something is real when perhaps it isn't.
66602f55d7e96ba10c35a4ac,"The responses provided by AI were coherent and flowed well, they got to the point with the answers and didn't include any details that weren't relevant."
5e7e1679f8a96f4be83e51e4,"very interesting study. I was really surpised with how good AI is. However, I didnt change my responses to the above questions as I feel that politicians should be able to debate a lot better given their position of power and salaries."
5d1290103b20b0000102e8e3,No changes were made to my evaluation.
59a7cfeb7ff2320001ec59d9,"I thought all responses were authentic, so perhaps I am not as familiar with AI as I thought! I think the use of AI in debates is very dangerous. Who feeds all the data in?"
63ebbb358ff6781d8dc68cdb,No I would not change my answers as even though I did not know it was AI it was believable enough to think it was a real person
568e997ce3ef9e000ca204d4,did not make any changes
59e7276d5de9b000017ed1c1,"After seeing the results, I believe that chatbots and AI can make valuable contributions to public debates, but there is still a question mark around the ethics of using them, ahead of human speakers."
5dfb7cbd01423f8a774d893b,no changes made
664f447336e82cfdd5232880,"No but I even more agree now that if AI is used, we should be told about it as finding out that some of the responses were AI was hugely shocking to me"
5987030cfd8cca00015cbc26,"I use AI but I would not have thought some of those were AI, it is very  convincing and worrying anything could be said and we would not know if it was real now !"
5e2872fffcdb020467d12799,I saw from the answers that the Cat AI was often more convincing and articulate than the suggested speaker
664f7e5bbe54e083251e2950,I haven't made any changes.
5d3821f0ddea5a0001757f93,I am obviously not quite as familiar with AI and chatbots as I thought I was.
64294e2b5234fdc8f81ffe6a,"Clearly, I was persuaded by the AI version in some of my choices. I felt those choices were clearer and less emotional so would concede that AI adds something but would caveat that when I read the full dialogue and background information of the speakers, the context became clearer and my choices may have been different. It is much easier when actually watching QT!"
5932e2c8b97ad00001745487,no changes
58ae2cb09e040a000139af76,Well I thought most of the answers were by real people so that's why i changed answer for the familiarity with chatbots and AI  My original choice was strongly agree but I changed it to agree because I could learn more
5ac8a695e1099600016aaae4,No changes - quite glad I seemed to prefer the non AI responses
5bc690392885710001a0bb76,no changes
62b57d34b7bdc2d0835fab76,Now having read a contribution by an AI then I can see there may be argument that it is to be considered.  I still say that it should be explained that it is AI usage when it is.
6163a7394293a6ff11d88f29,"i am not changing my mind because i dont believe we should be relying on ai, so the fact i believed them to be more coherent does not surprise me. i am however, dismayed!!"
640ce3e5772a5a2776ccddb5,Felt this was reasonable
5ca102f57114700016da340d,made none but ai should be more coherent than a person thinking on thier feet
6658df4ff45df15a18d4b115,I'm obviously very bad at spotting AI content when I'm not expecting it! So I've changed my (overconfident) familiarity judgement.
665acacd6f53305291fbd38e,I did not realise some of the responses were developed through AI. I still think this should be used responsibly.
666211d728f0722a3733b6ab,i changed my familiarity to chat bots and AI due to my answers I feel that I don't have as deep of an understanding than I thought.
5c7eb988ac63960015004d03,NO HAPPY WITH ANSWERS
66099d3fa3579e4e79fa013c,"I was not aware that there would be AI chatbot responses to judge. In retrospect, if I was looking out for AI generated responses, I would perhaps have been more aware some of these were not a human response. However, I do still stick to my views that it should be clear when they are used in political discourse."
666722d62b3848571df471ae,I would no longer say that you should use AI in a public debate. It is frankly alarming
5ecd36302b4d3c05d4cc1ba2,no changes
5c75c7c92c662600014eb328,"Because if AI/Chatbots are going to represent political speech, people need to know that."
5ea32a0ea7b59a0c92e82ac8,"No, I haven not made any change because I still think the same"
6655ecd3b5369fadf9c88349,I changed to answer that chatbots can be useful in debates - they were more coherent and relevant responses but do they reflect the real thoughts/feelings/wants of the person they're attributed to. We need to know if AI has been jused.
5e9027110aacc7320bd9a84b,"No changes BUT you say the response from Andy Burnham was a real response, not AI, but the response was complete gobbledegook. I'm pretty sure this is not a quotation from Andy Burnham or any other human..."
60375d67dde85cad87f3c99d,I made no changes to my evaluation.
64eb7975f0171c1552c78e48,"I obviously didn't recognise the use of chatbots as well as I thought I could! The responses that chatbots gave were, overall, more coherent and relevant to the questions."
65107bf7698f1e129de87140,Some of the texts contributed to politicians and the speakers connivingly came across as being attributed to them which is scary. I therefore do not believe AI should have any role in public debates.
6009c2e026bf46086f1c7267,I didn’t
60e85190b9cffd8fed0a064f,I don't want to change any of my evaluations thanks i stick by my decisions
665e1f12dbbf9d7d418516a6,It seems deceptive that i thought the original responses were genuine
6310ccbda708843d8c079b6d,No changes made
56cf683331a5bc000de1d20e,I was surprised to see which of the responses had been generated by AI.
6666fd54f2fee69fe282960e,"I was amazed that in every instance the AI contribution was more coherent: this made me change my mind about the value of AI in public debate, however I stick to my belief that this has to be made explicit."
65ba369a4bc6b2f1d6338e27,"I changed my response to the following ""I support the use of chatbots and AI in public debates"" from disagree to neutral as I had selected some AI responses as being more relevant and coherent. I changed it to neutral as I would need a lot more information to change it to agree."
60fd29f9a87256295399a571,"I think some of the AI generated responses contributed more to the public debate than the authentic human response, especially the John Lewis curtains example. So perhaps AI does play a bigger role in debate than I initially thought."
5bebf332cef79f00014d230c,"No I dont think so. Im supprised that I seemed to go towards the AI generated answers 
Good study which I enjoyed completing thanks"
65c8d7f023278532f6f49139,"The chatbots did have some logical and coherent arguments, perhaps better than the real life peoples arguments"
5ebd5fa512c47d04402403da,"I did change the answer to Chatbots and AI can make valuable contribution from disagree to agree. On reflection from what I have seen in the study, yes AI can make valuable contributions. I say contribution as it needs to be backed up by human involvement too. Also if AI is to be used, it has to be clearly marked and show how the information was gathered."
5af6e439672ea800010d4e92,I made no changes
5dc5da21d999de45a504651b,No made no changes
62ac74b89eae51a5db4986b0,"No changes, I still think the same about the use of AI in public debates"
660f3427b7f778967b512e8b,"I am familiar with chatbots and AI.

changed from strongly agree to agree, as I has made mistakes in the survey"
62d7443567d945a729647935,"I changed `Chatbots and AI can provide valuable contributions to public debates.` from disagree to agree due to how the information is conveyed in a very convicing manner and puts points across very well. I kept all of the other the same as the information is put across in a clear way, but it is important that every point put across is back up by facts and are not misleading"
628781515f29a0394e23b15b,I was  impressed by the coherence of AI responses.
5f5b4aa99a3ef626581a1473,"I believed the AI contributions were accurate and also relevant, therefore showing me that there can be a use for AI in gathering data to discuss a debate, though it should absolutely be regulated heavily and made explicitly clear that AI is making the argument"
5d41925ef7b99500012b960e,"No changes made - I stand by what I said! I would argue that the final question should really be two questions - Should AI be regulated? Yes, absolutely it should. Should AI only be employed in specific circumstances? No, I don't think so."
65ca3241aedc6b7667899114,AI can appear more authentic and maybe I shouldn't be so easily swayed into well written prose and think more about whether a human would say it or not!
62aa591a476ebabe28612a92,"No changes made. I stand by my beliefs in A.I. I feel as though it has it's purpose in the current climate of how everything works, but in terms of politics and debates, I'm not so certain on where I stand. I feel as though it could may be manipulated in a way still."
615eda024a5f84f408625b4f,"I haven't changed any of my responses. 

BTW - the times listed for the amount of type I spent on each response on the previous page were wrong. I'm not sure what software you're using to track that but it wasn't even close."
5ee3be6ff942c407cd54e6ce,I was fooled by the use of AI and feel that it should be transparent if AI technology is used
6639531c6c171de1a0de2617,"I did not change any answers, however I did notice that the AI-generated answers were the ones I perceived to be most relevant (i.e., actually answering the question at hand), so they could instead be used as a training tool for public speakers to actually answers the questions put to them"
662e46833238ec021abe2648,I was not aware of the fluency and accuracy that AI chatbots could provide even in a political context.
6659683e96aa5518f741716e,I am surprised by the number of answers I was not able to pick up as chatbots. I feel that I am used to seeing the structure and sentences that a chatbot uses but in this instance the data training was able to provide very human responses.
5bfaf2c95faf9d00019a52b8,"Following the responses, I feel that chatbots may be valuable if used constructively and that awareness of how the data was compiled is published."
660d5af29e8f6f8ac3be3749,"My thoughts remain broadly in line with my original answers, which is almost a blanket caution, but seeing the results I'm even less happy that AI chatbots can have any positive impacts. Some of the mismatches were quite plausible, and having no inclination from the start that AI would form a part of the survey (goes to the issue of transparency and ensuring use is disclosed and fully explained) then people can easily be 'taken in' by relatively normal sounding speech and text. This has obvious dangers in the realm of politics especially."
651af64eeab2e9f1c4ecd3b2,"No changes but I would like to expand on a couple of points.

""If chatbots and AI are used in public debates, we need to know what data the system was developed on.""
I chose neutral because I don't think knowing the datasets would help the general public, but it would be important information for anyone with more knowledge about AI.

""Chatbots and AI should be regulated and only be employed in specific circumstances.""

This was a tricky one for me because, on the one hand, I do think regulations are needed, but I think this would hinder innovation too much."
6658d06ebb57e6360147fbd6,"I am sticking with my original selections, but I was surprised with how I tended to think the AI generated responses were more authentic and coherent. This does have some alarming possibilities, especially with an election coming up. However, I don't think that AI chatbots should only be deployed in specific circumstances, but perhaps, should not be allowed during an election campaign for political use because there is the potential to cause confusion and spread misinformation when things can sound so authentic."
6272f5f3d37c1c9e88c115a2,It's really important that it is signalled if AI / Chatbots are used. There is a danger that they could be used to spread disinformation.
6664a70bf962b51495da41b8,I support the use of chatbots and AI now in Public Debate. Chatbots and AI can be useful in giving more researched and considered responses in Public Debates.
66607eab800ff4f96a6fe655,It is not surprising that responses supported by AI have been most articulate. The use of AI is acceptable but needs monitoring and regulating. I don't want to change the responses.
5c5ca0ce4ee81200018eaf51,"Provided that the AI is used only to better convey the genuine ideas of the speaker, it is useful. If an AI is told to use deceptive persuasive methods to sway votes or debates, then that is dangerous."
600a97750a20c621b3d6d358,"I support the use of chatbots and AI in public debates., went from Neutral to Agree.


Chatbots and AI can provide valuable contributions to public debates. , went from Neutral to Agree

n both cases AI can provide another and balanced point of view but it is subject to the inante rules imposed by the system developers so some caution is necessary. Real answers are provided on the fly under pressure so that has to be taken into any comparison."
65b9a002909e6b9bd3520066,I made some changes as when read and saw some of the AI answers they were significantly better than those that were not. So think maybe is a place for them but still feel that we should be aware in advise that AI.
65e4c3bb854b38d4312fed2f,I stick with my previous answers
667406bcdc6f783c2537e542,It needs to be clear to people that Ai is being used to inform their decision making.
665a31bc295a5ab4d0a349e8,"I changed my opinion on whether AI can provide valuable contributions to public debates from disagree to agree because it is clear that AI is able to imitate reasoning from economic and political statements in the past which gives it the imitation of good reasoning. From an accuracy point of view, this is fine. My initial worry is that the AI wouldn't be able to adapt to new topics but clearly, this isn't a massive problem. My only issue is that this would allow politicians to debate without authenticity or believing in their statements. It can also be argued that politicians were not authentic before AI."
66718bbb61a1ad0225968d18,"stayed the same, but being open to using AI even in debates should always be shared"
6093bbe2d2c5537241164571,I have made no changes. In fact I feel even more strongly that AI should not be used in public debates given how convicing some of the AI responses were.
5db09b3a9611830016dd495b,"I fully believed the only AI response was the last one, because it used such language that tripped me up and made me believe it was an AI response, seeing that it was a 'real' response and the others where an AI was a shock to me and made me realise that AI is a lot better at being more authentic than I realised and it's given me a lot more trust in AI responses and considering that I thought the last response was AI and all the others weren't I now feel that I'm not as familiar with AI as I thought I was previously"
62b182ba39468032223841bb,"I have not changed my evaluations, as I believe using AI without very clear labelling presents a risk in any public forum. However, it is clear that issues (including answers to questions) can be intelligently summarised and a balanced response given. I stand by my belief that if people should always be given the truth about the source of information - if that is AI, then it should never be presented as a human response. I believe this blurs moral and ethical (and possibly legal) boundaries."
666f1aec64844fbd48cd89b8,I made no changes
6657296c2b6895525a58537b,I felt as if i didnt recognise the AI text as i predicted i would
593c25fc048d06000182f21b,I did not make any changes but it increased my respect for AI as the answers the chatbots generated were often better than those of the real speakers.
654f97432dbb8563cf98d7c3,No changes
5996d2256b939900012d9f22,I feel strongly in my initial reaction.
665c674586e39a9d30720f53,"In terms of coherence, i think the AI were able to make the statements overall more coherent for the reader and therefore may provide a valuable contribution to public debates."
660fd68733720d48af43d1b3,I still think that if AI is used it absolutely needs to be specifically clear and as they are so good the only answer I would change is the last one from agree to strongly agree (specific circumstances question).
63d16bb09fbf6b74afb1a010,no changes made
596247c7b4a49e0001710d12,iI changed my answer concerning if AI can provide valuable contributions or not because i voted some answers highly thinking they were by a real person. Therefore i clearly thought they had a good point to make
6658b5488f1ee667f4263acd,The AI answers were definitely more coherent and made more relevant points. Maybe there is an element of being put on the spot in question time that made the real answers a bit 'messy' (for lack of better term) which put me off when reading them.
63e632b888bcbe9376df4f62,"No, the answers weren't in any way good, they were pretty poor all round - like the general tone of most responses by politicians who say nothing, having AI's say nothing for them is just the same pointlessness that we get from politicians (or even other voices who appear on question time)

The problem is the extremely low quality of all political rhetoric in the media today, that an AI can imitate it is not surprising, but calls more for a change in the standards of our journalists and politicians than it does on AI."
604d5e61486bd0622d2102c0,I felt some of my responses needed changing as I didn't realise that some of the more detailed and coherent debate responses to the questions were in fact generated by AI so that surprised me and pushed me to change some of my answers here. I do feel AI would be beneficial during debate.
6658e2cb395c02efada6a7a1,none
6671c7933ccf2789a44aa66b,"From what has been presented here I now think there is a role for Chatbots and AI to be used within public debates.  Some of the questions posed were interesting.  Some questions did have questionable sentences within them and some confusing statements but a combination of what Chatbots an AI construct, in collaboration with sources who can oversee and fact check what they have written is a possibility for future public debates."
659ea8c8d23b231204a14e63,"I am a bit confused with the results as the response I thought was not authentic contained a lot of spelling mistakes and bad grammar, some of which made no sense at all. I cannot imagine this being said on Question Time in response to the question."
665834040679fe2bd2dfed71,No change
5a3c1f1ef9451a00011e6f4e,i see now that AI can provide a valuable contribution to debates and it seems in a more structured and informative way
6638d4ee19c87bca8a26a415,the answers were so well put i had to change my mind
6161c4cc2d4f503e8265038e,"I just changed 'I support the use of AI in debates' to agree from neutral, because I agree they can add value."
6658b2472faf93a372286204,"i thought that AI generated text was obviously made by AI, but do not believe that i am as familiar with ai as i have seen the real response and fake one"
5d1794f9db7eb7001af1b00c,"It remains that an artifice, howsoever convincing, diminishes the intrinsic value of humanity and all that reflects its very essence. It is possible (for all I know!) that one could produce 10,000 ersatz Beethoven Sonatas, and just as many Chopin Waltzes by using artificial means, but would this not render them tedious, as commonplace? Worse, would there not be a risk that the same disengagement might reverberate onto the originals, too?!"
63f7a2d8acd4b0cead8773e9,NO CHANGES MADE.
5eddaa6d115bb4ac7e59f153,the chatbots gave more coherent answers than real people
6447a21bdb359b012f49465b,"I feel that, with anything, AI is an amazing tool but it needs to be monitored and disclaimed clearly. A lot of influence can come from it, good or bad depending on how it is utilised.

When a lot of it is influencing a lot of different people, spreading misinformation or something that isn't from the original source can be damaging."
60455b1578f6f36a3e8ea81c,I still have the same opinion.
660c1d15b19f4833ad06a1fa,"I was honestly surprised how logical and coherent some of the AI responses were. They actually seemed to provide some valuable insights into some of the questions asked, hence I changed a couple of my responses. I still strongly feel that where they are used, it's made explicitly clear how they are used and what data they have been trained on."
604fa685e33606f9a0ee8189,"♡ i have changed the last question from agree to strongly agree, as i believe while i support the use of AI in many different areas, but i think to prevent misinformation especially in politics where tactics are used, strong regulation and transparency of AI must be regarded. otherwise, AI will lose it's reputation and be seen as biased especially in debates."
5ece9e3b3a19db0cf5af6692,Im surprised by how I chose the side of an AI however I believe somewhat AI can be more factually accurate wherein a human can be more opinion based.
6658c28dbc36ded0ffe4727d,"It was interesting that the answer I rated as the highest in all 3 categories was actually AI generated. This has shown me that AI and chatbots can provide valuable contributions to public debate, however it has made me even less supportive of using them for that purpose as it shows that a 'perfect' answer can be achieved far too easily."
57b6dfafe2d5a60001099543,none
656de94bf069f0a1446f47c5,i am happy with my answers
666d9edc47ca746d72d772f3,"Responses by AI need to be explicitly told to the audience. In debates, MPs should not be allowed to give pre written responses by AI as this is an unfair and unscrupulous move."
66565f702a8c21be63eb93ce,I havent made any changes in it!
5bb20c4ce05c350001ef337e,I have not made changes.
63e51e063af1cc5baf0c72ca,"I answer truthfully and to my best extent, and do not intend to change any part of my evaluation"
64a9858be9b52e570ffb3c1e,"I agree that AI can be used in a certain way for much about anything, as long as it's made clear that it has been used, but in terms of persuading someone in terms of politics, I fail to see how AI could be the reason you vote for a certain party."
66463e1634506c3ca42bec35,"Yes, at the sentence ""Chatbots and AI can provide valuable contributions to public debates.
"" I changed my judgement from agree to strongly agree because I realised that AI can develop a speech that is more pleasing to the ear and has a much better chance of influencing the public."
66745cfbd6e10fd056860b83,I did not make any changes. I am fine with my answers.
5ea0631f1b0f64012fefc637,I havent changed my views
63cee98c7cce75401646795a,some of the response generated by AI shocked me.
61100c9dd41f288cd60f6415,No I wouldn't make any changes
614618f3146cc85f803c4e69,I didn't make any changes. I think AI is invaluable as a tool but it has to be made explicit that it has been utilised in this way.
6658cac52f184dccfa543511,Some of the AI answrs were very believable
5996cafd0ed7ae000199171d,No changes
592a6f9190cb9b000105e5de,i would rather humans have the public debates .
60ad78e3ca3cb1ab24c9d01f,I  changed my view on whether chatbots have a role to play in public debate. I was surprised at the data relating to the last three questions
66697400b1bdf9cd83b81b0b,I didn't make any changes.
5b1bc42168a5ed0001737ef3,No changes but by about Question5/6 I thought some of the answers were maybe AI generated
663a286f5a7137066aa0a017,"I think it can be disceiving if it is not the real person making the argument, and it may give them an unfair advantage from the opposition therefore it should be regulatede."
66797c7ee8bea8384dc38bba,None made.
6659a859ef9a59b67d086be9,"I feel like it is very easy to impersonate a real political figure using a chatbot, which I find concerning for the future. As such I changed one of my opinion points down one."
6658c2cfb6d37fb6ef8669dc,i am familiar with chat bots and ai

665b4d8a5be9070490ad686a,I am familiar with chatbots and AI question- yes I'm familiar with them but it's scary how I didn't pick up that any of the speaker's quotes were AI generated!
5915e5c6405db80001f30ff1,I am surprised by some of the answers AI gave so i have changed my answers
5ce9b0e4be5a6b00163f6870,None. N/A
5c5c539213005e0001ab6517,no changes made thanks
55e356dac70c7a00052a57ec,it seems i am rubbish at picking out AI generated responses
602fc8d80c9b4ad3a35ce223,"There needs to be 100% transparency of where the information came from, how it was generated and what the sources were i.e. the system it was developed on should definitely be disclosed."
66645eff20ea0a1d14a3d5bb,"After reading the debrief, I really believe that chat bots should never be used for political debates."
63d41641e3864dede6329c16,It looks like that I am very not good at recognising AI-generated speech but I have some sense though :D
57b71e418f963300014c8eaf,"i am familiar with chatbot and AI , but i did get a few respones wrong, but i do belive AL can only repeat what they are told , and do not know or understand what they are talking about, their only as good as the information they are fed."

5ce740c8636a5b0018f55968,"I am a little familiar with chatbots, but cannot always tell if they are used, so i changed my mind on a couple of the answers. I think we should be informed if they are used!"
5abe42840527ba0001c1db23,I was shocked that virtually every one of my responses was incorrect. I thought that some of the answers were too incoherent to have been given by a real speaker and guessed they were given by an AI. My level of inaccuracy would make me far more cautious in future.
59fc8a30087f2e0001ead66d,I finnd it very scary that chatbots couldd have provided some of the results.  I changed my answers to say I strongly disagree that chatbots can have good input into debates.  Chatbots ultimately only pull on information that they can find themselves via search engines (that is my understanding) but there are so many lies out there how can be trust anything they say!
65c9dd09090c48be1380c4b8,"My judgment within the debate questions were sometimes wrong and I'm not sure I would recognise an AI response, so now believe they should not contribute to public debates."
5b9e4dc6e671c60001228654,The only change I made was to agree more strongly that AI should be regulated. This study has demonstrated convincingly that its use in politics is dangerous.
667194f7dcc0ea2f5f06578e,Whilst I am familiar with chatbots and AI it is clear that my ability to identify what is real and what is AI generated is not as strong as I thought.
5c73d2817ed3a70001fc2929,"NO, BECAUSE I WAS USING MY AVAILABLE KNOWLEDGE, WHICH IS ALL I COULD DO REALLY"
661691f2685ea4472af1daa3,I thought I was familiar with chat bots but this has shown I am obviously not :(
611a8d23c1d17506a23df589,"By going through the answers to these questions on ""Question Time"".it is clear to me that some of the answers have been created by a generative AI system like ChatBGT.  In my line of work, I have become familiar with some ""ChatGBT words"" like ""underscored"" and ""leveraged"" and can easily recognise these from the supposed answers from the speakers, and this is a big giveaway.  After thinking about this I changed my mind and ticked ""disagree"" about the use of AI in public debates as these are computer-generated and formulaic answers that do not capture the real essence (nor sometimes authenticity) of what the speaker is saying."

571a82d06a1c6300094c6a19,Some of the answers that I wasn't sure about were generated by Ai so i changed my answer to say strongly agree that they have a valuable place in debate - well done Ai
62b2d869074bd11bce35650e,I didn't make changes to my responses because I had guessed that your research was probably connected with AI generated text. I therefore assessed the answers bearing that in mind.
59e7eb5d62637600014a7db2,The AI answers were convincing and would make me want to double check information on the net in the future.
634e8b77918a7fbb1be455c3,Chatbots should not be used in public debates. The participants should only be human with human failings and emotions.
661692cfc2dde70b43f7ab85,"No changes. I don't agree with the use of AI to sway or promote a point of view, especially if it is not disclosed that it is AI and where it is coming from."
6658bfd1b91466db56e72f0d,I couldn't recognize an AI generated response. So I changed answer 1.
5dbf1e36c97a8c3c0b008785,"I changed my answer to neutral to chatbots being used in public debates as every situation and debate is unique so guidelines and measures should support this, but I do not know how."
62c47e133958edd348b6b525,i prefer human interctions as u know its real with feelings and emotions it has substance and generates as real thoughts and choices
663a868c2596e92512a621bf,I would not change my answers as I still believe that the use of AI is areas such as this have to be utilised for specific reasons and highly regulated to ensure they will not sway voters incorrectly
6622b783843f78cf5354e223,I think it is useful to know the source of the information so we are aware it was ai generated and not human. This can help use make an informed decision regarding the data we are presented with
