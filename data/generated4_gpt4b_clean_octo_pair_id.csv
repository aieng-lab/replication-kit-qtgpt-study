As you say, some are going back. Some have said they would rather take their time to get the right arrangements in place. I agree we want to get the kids back in school if we can as quickly as possible, but it's got to be done as safely as possible. The key thing is here schools haven't closed. It is not as if they have not been doing anything over recent weeks. Of course they have been looking after children of key workers. I think teachers are feeling a bit stressed from the teacher-bashing they have seen this week. I think we need to sort of de-escalate this row a little bit. The problem is the government dropped a date on people of 1st June, without any real consultation. I think the way to resolve this is to say to head teachers in consultation with councils ""Try to get back by 1st June but as soon as you feel is safe as possible"". That feels to me to be the right resolution from where we are today.","Andrew Murray Burnham (born 7 January 1970) is a British politician who has served as Mayor of Greater Manchester since 2017.

We must acknowledge that while the immediate focus might be on social distancing and hygiene, the broader educational experience cannot be sidelined. We need a robust plan to ensure that no child is left behind due to the disruptions caused by COVID-19.

Firstly, we should look at enhancing our digital learning platforms to ensure all children have access to quality education remotely. This isn't just about providing devices but also ensuring reliable internet access and support for teachers to adapt to online teaching methods effectively.

Secondly, we need to support our teachers and schools in adapting to new ways of teaching that can accommodate both in-person and remote learning. This might mean smaller class sizes, staggered schedules, and continued professional development to manage these new challenges.

Lastly, we must not underestimate the psychological impact of this pandemic on our young people. Providing mental health support in schools will be crucial. We need to ensure that there are resources available for children to help them cope with the uncertainties and stresses brought about by the pandemic.

This is a generation-defining moment, and we must rise to the challenge by ensuring our educational system is resilient, inclusive, and adaptable to not just recover but improve from this crisis.","Thomas Kerridge (born 27 July 1973) is an English chef.

Moreover, we need to ensure that children's social skills and mental health are being cared for. This might involve more structured social activities that can operate within safe guidelines, or increased support services in schools.

We also need to think about the curriculum. Perhaps this is an opportunity to rethink how we educate our children, focusing more on skills that will help them in a rapidly changing world—like adaptability, critical thinking, and digital literacy.

Denmark is a much smaller country. We have a different political system, which I hope I can talk a little bit more about, based on much more compromise, consultation. Of course we could never send children back to school without deep consultation with teachers' unions, head teachers and also parents of course, but they did succeed in sending people back. One thing I was really impressed with, and as Prime Minister I had my fair share of shall we call it debates with the teachers' union, but one things I was really impressed by was how innovative they suddenly all became. They invented new ways of going to school. They had outdoor schools. Copenhagen teamed up with cultural facilities all over town. So suddenly you saw kids having education in our national stadium. They start out singing the national anthem. After that they had their class in the VIP lounge. You saw five year olds having their classroom in the National Museum of Art.","Helle Thorning-Schmidt (Danish pronunciation: [ˈhelə ˈtsʰoɐ̯ne̝ŋ ˈsme̝t]; born 14 December 1966) is a Danish retired politician who served as the 26th Prime Minister of Denmark from 2011 to 2015, and Leader of the Social Democrats from 2005 to 2015.

As educators and policymakers, we must adapt and innovate to ensure that learning continues effectively, even in these challenging times. We can leverage technology to facilitate remote learning, ensuring that children have access to quality educational materials and interactive learning opportunities.

Moreover, it's important to address the emotional and social impacts of this pandemic on children. Schools play a vital role not just in education, but in the social development of children. We need to think creatively about how we can foster a sense of community and support among students and teachers, even if they're not physically together. This might involve regular online meetings, virtual group activities, and ensuring that children have access to counseling and support services.

Finally, we must also consider the long-term implications of this disruption and be prepared to invest significantly in education once we emerge from this crisis. This could mean more funding for schools, additional training for teachers in digital competencies, and extended learning opportunities for students to catch up. It's a challenging time, but with the right focus and resources, we can turn these challenges into opportunities for reforming and improving our educational systems for the better.","Stephen James Fitzpatrick is a Northern Irish businessman, founder of OVO Energy, Vertical Aerospace and former owner of the Manor Racing team.",2

There are big and small classes. There are areas of great resource and areas of great deprivation. I think it is incumbent on our politicians to empower headmasters and teachers because they know what's best for children in their schools. I don't necessarily see a need for a uniform, standardised national rollout. I think the dates, times and methods need to be decided by the teachers. We have a whole generation here who are sat at home with these incredibly eager minds and desires to be learning. I think that's definitely one thing that the theatre industry in its lockdown has been reasonably good at. Education departments have been continuing to function and work with teachers to get actors sat at home and musicians sat at home to inspire kids in that way.

The disruption to education isn't just a logistical problem; it's a narrative one. How do we tell the story of this time to our children? How do we make them understand and cope with the changes without instilling fear or resentment? I think the arts and creative storytelling could play a crucial role here. We could develop plays, interactive experiences, and scripts that help children process what's happening in a way that's engaging and not so daunting.

Imagine a series of short plays written for, or even better, by children, that explore themes of resilience, community, and hygiene. These could be performed in school, respecting social distancing, or through digital platforms. This approach not only educates but empowers our children. It gives them a voice and a way to express their feelings about these strange times. It's about turning the narrative from one of disruption and fear to one of creativity and hope.

I understand how difficult the challenge is that they are dealing with. I have a lot of sympathy with that, but they seem to me to be repeating the same mistakes throughout this.

I think we are seeing that here. There is some doubts about the quality of the training being provided. You know, they really should have used the local expertise first and built from there.

You know, you can sympathise with the predicament in which Dominic Cummings and family find themselves while recognising at the same time many other people, hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, have faced comparable situations. They have obeyed and followed the Government advice and stayed at home. It is not unreasonable for them to expect people at the highest levels of Government to do likewise.

It's a fair point to wonder why we can't simply emulate these successful models. The answer, I suspect, lies in a combination of bureaucratic inertia and a certain not-invented-here syndrome that too often afflicts public policy in this country.

Other nations have been more agile, partly because they have either a more centralized approach to decision-making or because they have been more willing to adopt digital solutions swiftly. In contrast, the UK and Scottish governments have been somewhat slower, possibly due to concerns about privacy, data security, and the complexities of the devolved administrations.

There's certainly a case to be made for looking outward and learning from international best practices. Adapting these successful strategies could accelerate our own efforts without the need to reinvent the wheel. However, this requires not only political will but also a flexibility that has, so far, been somewhat lacking.

Many of these nations had robust systems in place even before the pandemic, which they could quickly adapt and scale up.

In contrast, here in the UK and Scotland, we've seen a tendency to start from scratch, often relying on new, untested systems and technologies. This approach not only leads to delays but also increases the risk of failures and inefficiencies. We should be looking to models that have proven successful elsewhere. This doesn't mean copying them exactly, but rather adapting their most effective elements to fit our specific needs and circumstances.

The Scottish Government and the UK Government must collaborate more closely, sharing data and insights, and learning from each other as well as from international examples.

In hindsight, as Nicola Sturgeon said this week, they would probably make some decisions differently. You know, at the time when people were released from hospital into care homes, it was because they feared that the NHS and hospitals were going to be overwhelmed with COVID cases. So, you know, what do we do with people who are delayed discharge, bed blocking or whatever. Well, get them out, almost regardless of their circumstance.That now, because the sort of tsunami of COVID cases didn't quite materialise, looks to be a terrible mistake and obviously with hindsight it was a mistake, but at the time it was made I think it's reasonable for politicians to say ""but this was the choice we had available to us"", but you can only do that I think, you can only get the public to trust you if you communicate with candor, if you allow that mistakes will be made in a fiercely complicated, unprecedented set of situations. But you can't just allow that mistakes will be make. You have to admit to them and take ownership of them as well.If you treat people like adults there is a chance they will understand the position you are coming from. You can't deny that any mistakes took place.

It is why, even though patience is beginning to wear thin, I think there is still a residual degree of goodwill for the Government, if the Government can be shown to be responsive to this situation, can show that it is accepting and taking ownership of mistakes, and the care home situation is clearly one of them. You can't go around prattling on about how you are throwing a protective ring around care homes at the same time as thousands and thousands of people are dying in care homes.Final point of the question.

As for the financial reparations related to slavery, this is indeed a troubling chapter of our history. The government has acknowledged this historical fact, and it's crucial we continue to educate the public about all aspects of our past. However, any form of apology or further action would need to be considered carefully, taking into account both historical context and the implications for today's society. It's about finding a path that respects the past but also looks forward to building a more inclusive future.","Kavita Oberoi OBE (born 27 April 1970) is a British entrepreneur.

And will you apologise for paying off the owners of slaves that the British people were paying off until as late as 2015?","I totally disagree with you actually.  Because I absolutely relish that statue being toppled in Bristol.  They had tried for decades to either get the statue removed, or to get a plaque put on the statue, to provide the context for Colston’s history as a slave trader.  And I think everybody now knows that he was culpable in terms of some 80,000 Africans being enslaves in the New World, and 20,000 of those Africans were also lost at sea. So, I think he was a really toxic symbol in Bristol, and it was really important that he should go, or at least be contextualised.  And people tried to do that, and they tried for decades.  They didn’t get anywhere with it.  So, it felt to me that it was totally right that they should topple that statue, because of what he represented, and I am totally for a lot of the other statues in this country, being removed, and perhaps recontextualised in museums, or somewhere where we actually  understand what role they played in society in a wider sense, and the whole idea about… But, there is also this argument that’s come up, in terms of the statues, that we can’t change history and that it is the history of this country.  But actually, history is a construction.  Okay, events happen, we have a past, and then historians contextualise that past and interrogate it.  And what’s happened in this country, is that historically that has been done by elite white men, who have been the historians, who have set the framework for the events of the past.  So, history is something that needs to be challenged, and re-interrogated, and revised constantly. And removing those statues, in a sense it’s giving power to the people who really do object to a symbol of their historical slavery and all their allies as well.  The other thing about history, is that history has always excluded primarily women and people of colour, and working class people and LGBTQ+ people, in the ways in which it’s been told.  And that also goes to what you were saying about the colonial history.You know, a lot of people in this country don’t understand the colonial history, or they understand it through a certain prism, where they feel that Britain went and travelled all over the world, in order to help people.  You know, there is still a section of society who don’t think slavery was a really bad thing.So, I think it’s really important that we interrogate history and when you have to take the law into your hands and remove a statue, I mean, God, nobody died, you know, it’s just this little tin statue, whatever it was, that was thrown into the river, and it then led to this conversation that we’re having now, about the rest of the relics of Britain’s murky past, then I think it’s really important.","Bernardine Anne Mobolaji Evaristo OBE FRSL FRSA (born 28 May 1959) is a British author and academic.

These should not stand in public places of honor but perhaps be moved to museums where they can be contextualized properly.

As for an apology, it is not just about saying sorry, but about acknowledging the wrongs and the deep, lasting impacts they have had. It's also about reparative justice. The fact that the British taxpayer was compensating slave owners until 2015 is a stark reminder of how the legacies of these atrocities are not just historical footnotes but have contemporary repercussions. An apology needs to be part of a broader, more systemic change that addresses the inequalities and injustices that persist.

As a hotelier, my primary focus has been on hospitality and creating environments where people from all walks of life can feel welcome and valued.

Regarding the statues and portraits that represent figures from the past with contentious legacies, it's a complex issue. It involves balancing historical context with contemporary values. I think it's crucial for there to be a dialogue, a conversation that involves various perspectives to understand better and decide how we should best represent our history in public spaces.

As for the financial reparations related to the slave trade, this is indeed a matter of national concern and should be addressed at governmental levels. An apology, if deemed appropriate by the collective societal and governmental consensus, should aim to acknowledge past wrongs and help heal historical wounds, contributing to a more inclusive and aware society.

But the Black Lives Matter campaign is not a campaign to re-engineer our public space and remove statues, it’s actually not even about the death of George Floyd, it’s about the persistent and continuing racial inequalities, that affect not just America but other countries around the world, including our own.

Regarding the statues and portraits that glorify figures associated with slavery and exploitation, I believe it's time we re-evaluate what and whom we choose to celebrate in our public spaces. These symbols matter because they say a lot about what we stand for as a society today. It's not about erasing history, but rather about highlighting the many perspectives of our shared history, especially those that have been historically marginalised.

As for the financial reparations for slave owners, it's a stark reminder of the injustices that can be perpetuated by systems of power. An apology is due, certainly. More importantly, though, we must commit to systemic change that addresses the legacies of these injustices.

We know that we live in a racist society. Adam Price has called for an enquiry into structural racism in Wales, it was in response to his questioning that the first minister of Wales responded with supporting the concept of a black and minority ethnic museum in Wales, and also it’s been Plaid Cymru who’s been leading on perhaps the major point, which is changes to the curriculum.Now, looking at the statues, and I raised this yesterday with the Prime Minister, of course, what we have within the United Kingdom is the way of presenting history very much through the eyes of the Conservatives.  And the Prime Minister, when I asked him on this question, is that Conservatives don’t pull down statues, Conservatives don’t pull down statues.  It was the imagery of the past.  And I know that the Lord Chancellor will agree with this, we have much legislation in place to deal with racial hatred, but we know that we still live within a racial society, which acts upon racialism and racism.So, the question that I have for us now, is how are we going to bring about the big social changes, the big changes in attitudes?  That’s why the statues are so interesting, because they are so symbolic of a certain sort of history that said the Empire was fine, that the British Empire was a force for good, and a force for good only in the world.  This is not true.  And now is the time to come to recognise that it isn’t just the history of powerful white men, who often made their money and their fortunes out of the sufferings of others.

Regarding the statues and portraits of individuals who profited from the slave trade and the Empire, it is clear that public spaces should celebrate figures who embody the values of equality and human dignity. Where statues and other representations do not align with these values, communities should be empowered to decide their fate through democratic processes and informed debate.

As for the matter of an apology, it is indeed a powerful step towards reconciliation.

A system is only as good as its ability to reach and impact the entire community it serves. Therefore, it's crucial that we look at not just the numbers but the stories and the lived experiences behind these statistics. We need to understand why people are hesitant to provide contact details. Is it fear of stigma, lack of trust in the system, or concerns about privacy?

Every challenge, every barrier, it's an opportunity, a call to innovate, to rethink how we approach the world of work. As a young person today, you're not just walking into a job market; you're stepping into a moment in history where your voice, your actions, can redefine the future.

You ask for assurances, and I say, the assurance lies in your ability to adapt, to learn, and to harness the collective power of your generation. You're digital natives, born into technology and change, making you uniquely equipped to navigate this new terrain. The opportunities? They're there, but they might not look traditional. Think entrepreneurship, think tech, think creative industries where your voice and your skills can shine.

So, keep your head up, stay informed, and get involved. Connect, create, and collaborate. The path isn't just about finding opportunities; it's about creating them. And in this interconnected world, your impact can resonate far beyond your immediate surroundings.

And the reality is that the Government needs to announce, already have announced what it's going to do to help businesses, get young people into training, into schemes,there can be different sectors, there can be different standards and it needs to be responsive to what is actually happening out there, because, without it, we're just going to end up with a generation lost. And even in the announcements last week with regard to the tutoring that school children will now get, very welcome announcement, but an hour before the announcement was made, those aged 16 to 18 were taken out of it, and these are the people who are -- we are going to need to help, who have already lost all their youth services, had their schools cut for the entire time that they might have been there.Now is the time to step up.

We have learnt that we can be at productive when we are at home, if not more productive.

Moreover, the heightened awareness and improved standards of hygiene are crucial. We've seen how simple practices like more frequent handwashing can drastically reduce the spread of viruses. These habits should remain ingrained in our daily routines to safeguard public health beyond this pandemic.

Additionally, the pandemic has spotlighted the digital divide and prompted an acceleration in digital access and literacy. This progress must continue to ensure equitable access to information and opportunities, especially in education and public services.

And even on the day that we had that vote in the houses of parliament, that Labour had called and the day that the government decided to U-turn, the Prime Minister was at the dispatch box denying the existence of 600,000 children who’ve been pushed into poverty since 2012 and the fact that that is projected to rise.Now, this is a result of an approach to government that has systematically stripped support away from children over the last decade, so that now schools in my constituency have to employ workers using the pupil premium to go round to children’s houses, stock their cupboards, put money in the gas or electricity meter, and deal with rats and mice because the parents just simply don’t have enough money to make ends meet. I say, let’s get back to a new normal and build a better country based on better values when we come out the other side of this, because children have been last up to now and they’ve been invisible. Let’s make sure that when we rebuild this country, let’s change that and let’s make sure that they come first.","Lisa Eva Nandy (born 9 August 1979) is a British Labour Party politician serving as Shadow Cabinet Minister for International Development in 2023.

While I'm not an educational expert, my perspective as a writer and producer who delves into complex societal issues might offer a unique angle. A six-month delay in learning isn't just a simple pause; it's a disruption that can ripple across various aspects of a child's development and future opportunities. In storytelling, we often explore the profound impacts of seemingly small events on characters' lives, and this situation is no different in the real world.

From my viewpoint, the narrative isn't solely about the delay—it's about the compounded effects on a generation already facing numerous challenges. This includes mental health issues, social inequality, and access to technology, which can exacerbate the divide between different groups of students. The real question is how resilient our systems are and how they can adapt to not only recover lost ground but also innovate to prevent long-term detriments.

Will it make a difference to prevent a second wave?","Yeah, I think it does matter and, you know, we very much supported the government in trying to set this up, because in the end if you get the app up and running it will save lives. The problem is that the government were warned repeatedly from the outset that the path that they were taking was not going to work because the technology just wasn’t compatible with a lot of phones. Now, there were other countries like Germany and Australia, who were taking a similar path to our government, trying to develop their own technology, realised that it wouldn’t work, listened to those warnings, and actually went down a different path. And as a result Germany has just managed to launch their app yesterday and is quite confident about how that’s going to work. So, we’ve really got to start breaking the pattern here, which is of a government that shuts people out, doesn’t listen to advice, doesn’t seek to learn from expertise here in the UK and overseas, and then finds later that they’ve got to revisit those plans because they’ve unravelled very very quickly.

Because the government set up their own private sector testing facilities around the country, so GPs just simply don’t know whether their patients are testing positive for COVID. Public health directors are looking closely at local outbreaks and having to make decisions about managing local outbreaks, but because they’re not getting that information, they just simply don’t have the tools that they need to do the job. So, we need a reset here.

And actually I’m very proud of the fact that I’m part of a government that has made some real differences. So, for example, and I know these figures will now be distorted because of the situation with the coronavirus, but up until that point, the increase in employment had disproportionately benefitted people from black and other minority groups. And having a job, I think we’ll all agree, is a foundation stone for a better life.We have looked at the impact of stop and search. When I worked with Boris Johnson when he was Mayor of London, we looked at how crime disproportionately affect black Londoners, and he’s carried that passion now with him into Downing Street. And it’s easy when people say, oh, you know, we should do something, and when asked what exactly we should do, you are able to give an answer, because it is not simple and it is not the kind of change that can happen overnight. But I’m incredibly proud of the work that the Prime Minister has done both as prime minister and as mayor of London to try and close the gap between the lives…the lived experience of ethnic minorities in the UK and the norm.","Lieutenant Colonel James Spencer Cleverly TD VR (born 4 September 1969) is a British politician and Army Reserve officer who has served as Home Secretary since November 2023.

One of the biggest ones that I see is really based around social mobility. And the frustrating thing for me is that we all have it in our power to make a difference. You know, again, this is one of those things we can put to government, or we can make a change. And, you know, what I see in the boys that we’ve got is that they don’t have…even if they’re, you know, academically strong or bright, they don’t have the networks that we have. They don’t get the opportunities that people in our network get.And all of the people that were involved in the protests, you know, from the privileged side of the debate, if you like, can all make a difference. They all run companies, they own companies, they can give opportunities, whether it’s work experience, internships, to help people along the road on the journey. And we can start making a difference now, we can all individually start making a difference tomorrow, and we know we can. And we don’t need to wait for a government review to do it. The government review may help, it may come up with things that we can do with the police and to change attitudes. I certainly think, having looked at this whole issue of history and statues, that we need to review some things. You know, I think if we wouldn’t put a statue up of that person now, why would we continue to have it? You know, do we want a statue to a man who brought 90,000 slaves into the country and killed 19,000 of them?

It’s about changing recruitment practices so we get far better representation at every level in the criminal justice system, in work places and across society. It’s about having a better education system so that people understand how discrimination actually works and understand the complexity of the history that we’ve got. It’s about having better legal representation. It’s about incomes as well.Talking about child poverty, but actually if you’re black you’re more likely to be poor, you’re more likely to be stopped by the police.

This approach contrasts with the handling of the situation in England, where there have been significant criticisms regarding the timeliness and clarity of decisions made. Our government has endeavored to base our responses on the best available scientific advice and to communicate those decisions transparently, which I believe has fostered a higher level of public trust and compliance.

But there have been big mistakes in Scotland and we have to accept that and listen to the advice we are hearing and learn from them. In Scotland we had people testing positive for Covid-19 in a hospital being discharged into a care home. We have to learn from that. Nicola Sturgeon told us there would be a support in September; we’re still waiting in October for that. We have the highest percentage of deaths in the care home setting anywhere in the UK here in Scotland. So no one can claim a success. It is a battle that we are all still fighting.

For example, the approach to care homes and the vaccination rollout had its set of challenges that could have been handled better.

In contrast, while not without its faults, the UK Government, led by Boris Johnson, implemented a swift vaccine procurement and distribution strategy that was among the fastest in Europe. This has been crucial in saving lives and getting society back to normal more quickly.

It's essential to look at the results and the data, and from that perspective, the management of the pandemic in England has had aspects that were managed more effectively compared to Scotland.

I think what we have to do is learn from what is working well in other countries. Frankly, I think it would be easier if there was a bit more commonality in the approach across all the countries of the UK. The bottom line is SAGE is looking through the lens of controlling the pandemic. They are also having to balance the difficult tight rope of the miserable health consequences for other people as well, which is the effects of the economic damage -- the unemployment, the damage to education. But I think what we have to do is we need a really clear strategy. I think that has been less visible.

From a scientific standpoint, the effectiveness of pandemic response can be measured by several indicators including the rate of infection, the effectiveness of public health communications, and the implementation of mitigation strategies. Nicola Sturgeon took a notably cautious approach, often diverging from decisions made in England by implementing stricter measures at different times. This approach appeared to be rooted in a close alignment with scientific advice from Scottish advisors.

On the other hand, Boris Johnson's government faced significant challenges, and the response strategy evolved over time, sometimes marked by rapid policy shifts which could be seen as reactive rather than proactive. The effectiveness of these strategies has been widely debated, but it is clear that public health decisions were influenced by a complex interplay of scientific, economic, and political factors.

The UK UK government, it seems to me, has lost control of the virus. They are losing confidence. They’re no longer following scientific advice. We have not seen Nicola Sturgeon come forward to follow the scientific advice that came through in the way that it did from SAGE. Under the SNP government you’ve already mentioned that we have the highest R rate in the UK. Both governments were far too slow in setting up test, track and isolate or test and protect. And my worry is with those businesses and livelihoods at stake now, if we don’t have a way that both governments are going to learn from what has gone wrong and be honest and open about it and work together more closely, we are going to go into a winter where it will be much more difficult for all of us.

Nicola Sturgeon has demonstrated a very focused and often cautious approach, which has been quite distinct from Boris Johnson's strategy. In Scotland, the communication has been consistent and clear, which is critical in maintaining public trust and compliance during such crises. The devolved powers allowed Scotland to tailor its response to the specific needs and circumstances of its people, which has been an advantage.

On the other hand, Boris Johnson faced a broader range of challenges, managing responses across England with a diverse population and greater density, which naturally complicates the public health response. However, the consistency of messaging and decision-making has been less stable.

From a business perspective, understanding and predictability in policy-making are key for operational continuity and planning. In this regard, the Scottish government's handling provided a clearer framework within which businesses could operate under the pandemic conditions. Therefore, while both leaders faced unprecedented challenges, the approach in Scotland under Nicola Sturgeon has had aspects that I, as a businessman, would consider more effective in certain contexts, particularly in terms of communication and specific tailoring of policies.","Jessica Rose Phillips (née Trainor; born 9 October 1981) is a British politician serving as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Birmingham Yardley since 2015.

The second thing is that, going back to the last question, the numbers aren’t going down because we’re on average making too many social contacts. So we know that lockdown works because when this pandemic started with tight restrictions it did come under control. Restaurants, cafés, it depends, actually, how people are seated. It depends how people behave, whether they are inside or outside. I think that when you read through, and I read through before coming, all the different restrictions, I looked at Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales, it is very confusing, and it is different. The bottom line is we need to reduce our social contacts, and until we get it down similar to the levels we started with, this is not going to come under control. Frankly, we do need to get on top of the second wave and urgency does matter. So we just have to get on with it and I don’t think it is helpful having lots of different hard-to-understand rules., there isn’t a science that says what a restaurant is or a café. Nor is this a specific science that says 6 people or 5 people or 7 people. What has to happen is that our social distancing has to be maintained. Of course, we are all in this together. Everyone has a responsibility here. But the rules have to be clear and I think the argument for a circuit breaker is it is tough but short. If we can, by a month’s time, get the numbers down, then we have to get testing and tracing on top of it rather than chasing behind. At the moment, although the numbers number of available tests has gone up, it is still chasing demand. We are only going to decrease if we get on top of it.

A café becomes a restaurant when the focus shifts from casual drinks and light snacks to more substantial meals, often accompanied by a more formal setting. Conversely, a restaurant might take on the characteristics of a bar in the evenings if it offers a vibrant nightlife scene with a focus on drinks and perhaps live entertainment.

In the UK, the lines can blur differently in cities like Edinburgh, Cardiff, Belfast, or London, largely due to local licensing laws and cultural nuances. For instance, Edinburgh's historic setting and tourist appeal might influence establishments to cater to a broader international palate and extend operating hours. In contrast, Belfast might have more traditional pubs that seamlessly transition into evening hotspots. Each city has its unique regulatory environment and cultural expectations, which influence how establishments are categorized and operate.

We should absolutely not be addressing it again. What’s gone completely wrong in the last two or three years is that we’ve got a Scottish government who generally are adversarial and negative about a whole range of things that might happen with the UK and Scotland working together. That’s what we should have. We don’t have a devolved government which is just looking after Scotland at all. We have a devolved government who are focused on independence. What we need is a devolved government who will work with the UK government. I have a list of six different things here which could happen, but right now are being held back because, frankly, the Scottish government’s position is they don’t want any big money help from the UK government because somehow it will cut across the the devolution right. So the structure and the system right now just isn’t working. If we could get that sorted out and, honestly, get both governments working together in a whole range of quite exciting things that could be done, we would be able to look ahead. We’re not.

It's not just about the numbers in a poll, but about the underlying sentiments and the economic, social, and political implications of such a decision.

In terms of timing, it's crucial that any approach to this matter is conducted thoughtfully and pragmatically. The government should not indefinitely delay addressing this issue, as uncertainty can be detrimental to business and investment, both of which are vital for Scotland's prosperity, irrespective of its constitutional status. A balanced, informed debate on the future of Scotland within or outside the UK is essential. This should be addressed sooner rather than later, ensuring that all perspectives, including economic impacts and opportunities, are thoroughly evaluated.

Children this year who have seen a disrupted education, it is not going to magically correct itself next year.

Then we saw the Brexit referendum with all the division that brought. I think people want a period of healing. They want the whole country to be working together. That’s certainly where Keir Starmer is focused. Because if he is prime minister, as I hope he will be, he wants to be prime minister of the whole of the United Kingdom.

As a scientist, my approach is to look at evidence and the robustness of data, such as the polling figures you mention. However, the decision to hold another referendum on Scottish independence involves complex political, legal, and constitutional considerations that extend beyond scientific analysis.

From a governance perspective, it is crucial that any major political decision, such as a referendum, is made following thorough deliberation and in accordance with the legal frameworks that govern the United Kingdom. The UK government must balance a variety of factors, including the legal precedents, the political implications for all parts of the union, and the economic impacts.

While the desire for a referendum can be strong, it is also essential for the government to ensure that any major constitutional change is pursued in a manner that maintains stability and considers the well-being of all citizens across the union.

It finds the Labour party acted unlawfully. It finds that Jeremy Corbyn’s office effectively covered up 23 different allegations of antisemitism. But it think this goes beyond just Jeremy Corbyn. I think Keir Starmer has questions to answer himself, because for five years Keir Starmer sat on the Labour front bench and said nothing while this was going on. I didn’t hear him condemning this activity, I didn’t hear him holding Jeremy Corbyn to account, unlike many other Labour MPs and many Labour front benchers. He didn’t resign from that front bench. He said nothing. He defended Jeremy Corbyn, and indeed he promoted Jeremy Corbyn as a potential Prime Minister less than a year ago. So I think Keir Starmer needs to do two things if he’s serious about fixing this. Firstly, he should apologise personally for his failure to speak out on this issue when he was on the front bench, because it was all very convenient for him to sit there and say quiet in the hope that he would then take over as leader. Rather cynical I think. And secondly, he needs not to just suspend Jeremy Corbyn, he should kick Jeremy Corbyn out of the Labour party because this report is so damning, and Jeremy Corbyn’s response to it this morning saying the whole thing had been hugely exaggerated for political purposes, was disgraceful.

We are profoundly sorry for that hurt that has been caused. Today’s report, it’s an appalling, damning report that is before us, but we now have to act upon the recommendations of that report. We will now work to ensure that yes, our complaints processes are improved, that they are independent, they are where they should be. But we will do more than that. The answer to this isn’t just about process, important though that is, it’s about changing the culture of our party so that it is a place where everybody feels welcome and everybody feels safe.

I know there is a long way to go, but Keir’s speech and our commitment to taking action on this is the start of that road.Well, look, I can’t comment on whether individuals want to take legal action around particular bits of the report, but obviously, number one, I say that we will of course be holding people to account. That’s why we’re going to improve our complaints system.We have to put an action plan together now by 10 December. We will be reaching out to the Board of Deputies, to the Jewish Labour movement, the wider Jewish community as we do that to ensure that we do have a system, that there is no political interference, that it’s properly resourced and people are properly trained, that is transparent, that has proper rules about what sanctions are appropriate so everyone can have confidence in that.But there is, as I say, a wider question here. That process is vitally important and we will put it in place, but there’s a fair challenge too about changing the culture, and we change the culture through leadership. We change it through leadership by what Keir Starmer has been saying and doing over the past six months. I mean, one of the reasons I backed Keir for leader was those conversations I had with him about his determination to tackle this issue.

We have to listen, because of that trauma of enslavement. And I’m going to say the same thing about the Jewish people.

There's a palpable fear of the repercussions on businesses, many of which might not survive another total shutdown. This is weighed against the public health crisis, a balancing act of immense difficulty.

The leadership is possibly wary of the backlash from imposing another stringent lockdown.

Lastly, there's the matter of timing and data interpretation. The government might be interpreting the data differently, or betting on improved outcomes due to vaccine rollouts and other measures. It's a gamble, certainly. The challenge lies in making decisions with far-reaching consequences based on projections and models, which, while scientifically informed, cannot predict the future with absolute certainty.

This is where a large portion of the population becomes immune to the disease, thereby reducing its spread. The exact percentage of people that need to be vaccinated to achieve this can vary depending on the disease's infectiousness. Generally, experts suggest that about 70% to 85% of the population needs to be vaccinated to effectively break the chain of transmission and protect those who are not immune.

However, it's crucial to understand that vaccination is not just about individual protection; it's about community protection. This means we need a high uptake across different communities, including those that are often underserved or hesitant about vaccination. Ensuring equitable access to vaccines, clear communication about the benefits and safety of vaccines, and robust public health strategies are essential components to make any vaccination campaign successful. We must work collectively to build trust and ensure that everyone understands the importance of vaccination not just for their own health, but for the health of all around them.","Seema Malhotra (born 7 August 1972) is a British politician serving as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Feltham and Heston since 2011.

I think what is encouraging, if we also believe the news coming out of Russia, we’ll see a series of vaccines coming through which may have different advantages for distribution. Right now we have to work as if this is the only vaccine that’s going to work but we could have a different conversation in four weeks’ time. I think it comes to this issue of prioritisation. It is a difficult vaccine to get out. There’s about 10 million vulnerable population. If you start vaccinating in January, given that it takes 5 to 6 weeks to get immunity, and you did a million people a week, we wouldn’t get that 10 million vaccinated until way into April, and that’s assuming everybody comes in for their first shot and for their second shot and you are not playing catch-up.

At Imperial College, we've been deeply involved in the development of novel vaccine technologies, including those requiring specialized storage solutions. The storage facilities must be equipped to maintain specific temperature conditions that are often well below the freezing point. This is not just about having the right equipment; it's also about having robust monitoring systems in place to continuously verify that the storage conditions are maintained without interruption. Additionally, training personnel on the proper handling and storage procedures is paramount to prevent any accidental exposure to inappropriate conditions, which could compromise vaccine efficacy.

Additionally, leveraging trusted figures in the community, such as doctors and local leaders, to disseminate this information can personalize the message, making it more relatable and less corporate. It's also crucial to address the economic implications of the vaccine. Explaining how a successful vaccine deployment will lead to economic stability can align financial interests with health outcomes, which is a persuasive angle for many.

Finally, ongoing education campaigns that adapt to emerging questions and concerns can help maintain public confidence.

Furthermore, we need to engage with communities through trusted figures, such as local leaders and healthcare professionals who people know and respect. These figures can play a crucial role in addressing concerns directly, dispelling myths, and conveying the importance of vaccination for public health and the return to normalcy.

It's also vital to acknowledge and address the specific concerns people have about the vaccine, whether they're about potential side effects, the speed of its development, or its long-term efficacy. Addressing these concerns directly, with evidence and empathy, rather than dismissing them, will help build trust.

They saved more lives than any other medicines. People are concerned about this vaccine because they perceive it has been done too quickly. We have done a disservice by saying it takes ten years to make a vaccine. Technology is changing very, very quickly. What has happened is that the same number of participants have been exposed to this vaccine, this particular vaccine, 43,000 participants. When you’re looking at side effects, most side effects occur very quickly, within a week or so of having a vaccine. We would see any severe side effect at this stage. And no regulatory authority, whether it is the UK be medicines regulatory authority or the European Regulatory Authority or the FDA will let anything go through that doesn’t have a totally squeaky clean safety record. Now, one thing that I think people completely forget is that a vaccine stimulates your immune system, it tricks it to see if it has seen the virus. So you are getting an aspect of a viral infection that’s so much minor than the real virus. So when you think about the risk benefit, the risk of having a severe outcome from Covid-19 far outweighs any theoretical risk of a vaccine. The problem is vaccines are so successful that diseases go away and all you see is the side effects. Pull out any -- par cell Mo approximately, you probably all had it. Look at the potential side effects of paracetamol. If you never taken it before it would probably scare you to take it but you don’t have the same same because you are familiar with it.

From a scientific standpoint, the regulatory autonomy gained post-Brexit allowed the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) to approve vaccines more swiftly than if we were still under the European Medicines Agency (EMA) regime. This regulatory independence did indeed facilitate a more agile response in terms of vaccine approval and deployment within the UK.

However, it's important to consider that vaccine development and deployment are influenced by a multitude of factors beyond regulatory frameworks. These include scientific collaboration, manufacturing capabilities, and logistical considerations. The UK has a strong scientific research base and significant expertise in epidemiology, which have been crucial in the context of the pandemic. The collaboration with international partners remains essential, and it's important to note that many of the successes in vaccine development have been due to global efforts.

In summary, while Brexit provided the UK with the regulatory flexibility to move quickly in some areas, the overall speed of vaccine deployment was the result of a combination of factors, including the robustness of the scientific community and existing infrastructure in vaccine research and development.","Michelle Emma May Elizabeth Donelan (born 8 April 1984) is a British politician serving as Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology since July 2023, having previously served in the position from February to April 2023 before being temporarily replaced during her maternity leave.

It's crucial to recognize that vaccine development and deployment are influenced by a myriad of factors, including scientific innovation, public health infrastructure, and international cooperation. Our ability to move quickly in some areas does not negate the challenges and potential downsides of Brexit, including significant concerns about our long-term public health strategy and international standing in science and medicine. As we move forward, it's essential that we focus on building robust systems for public health and ensure that we are not isolating ourselves from the global scientific community.

This autonomy allowed the UK to approve vaccines more quickly and to secure substantial vaccine supplies early on, which was crucial in the context of a global pandemic where time is of the essence. The ability to make these decisions independently, without needing to wait for consensus among 27 member states, certainly played a role in the speed of the UK's vaccine deployment.

In shopping centres, people are constantly moving, not typically congregating for prolonged periods, which might be seen as less of a risk for spreading germs compared to sitting down for a meal or a drink at a pub where you're stationary and interacting closely with others for a while.

In a pub, every aspect from the seating arrangements to the handling of food and drink is intimate and personal. We take great care to ensure everything is up to scratch, hygiene-wise. But perhaps the decision-makers see these settings as more challenging to manage when it comes to enforcing social distancing measures. It's tough on the industry, certainly.

In shopping centres, people generally move around more and are less likely to be in close, face-to-face contact for extended periods. This movement can potentially reduce the risk of sustained transmission of respiratory viruses, which are primarily spread through close contact.

In contrast, pubs and similar settings encourage prolonged close interactions, often in poorly ventilated spaces, which significantly increases the risk of airborne transmission of viruses. People in pubs also tend to speak louder, sometimes shout, or sing along to music, which can expel more respiratory droplets into the air, further increasing the risk of spreading infections. Additionally, the consumption of alcohol can affect people's judgment and adherence to social distancing measures, making it more challenging to maintain safe practices.

Therefore, while it might seem inconsistent at first glance, these regulations are based on scientific understanding of how respiratory infections spread and the different behaviors typical in these settings. It's all about managing risk and trying to keep the public as safe as possible while allowing some level of normal activity to continue.","Lucy Maria Powell (born 10 October 1974) is a British politician serving as Shadow Leader of the House of Commons since 2023.

This involves not only direct investment in educational institutions but also reviewing and potentially reforming the current funding models to make them more equitable. Education is an investment in our future, and it is crucial that this investment is made fairly and with consideration for those who might not have ample resources.

Moreover, the shift to online learning, while necessary, should not be seen as a lesser form of education that can be charged at the same rate as in-person sessions without providing the same value. We must advocate for a pricing model that reflects the actual cost and quality of the education delivered, ensuring fairness and accessibility for all students.",Sir Rocco Giovanni Forte FCA FIoD Cavaliere di Gran Croce OMRI (born 18 January 1945) is an English hotelier and the chairman of Rocco Forte Hotels.,144

In the hospitality industry, like in education, we strive to provide the best possible experience and service, which often involves significant costs. But it's crucial to ensure that what we offer is accessible to everyone, regardless of their economic background.

From my perspective, if students are feeling that they're not getting enough contact time or resources for their tuition fees, then universities need to look at that seriously. It's all about balance, isn't it? Just like in a restaurant, where we have to make sure that the price of a dish is justified by the quality of the ingredients and the cooking, in education, the costs should clearly reflect the level and quality of teaching provided. And, of course, there should always be measures in place to support those who might struggle financially. It's about fairness and making sure everyone has the opportunity to succeed, which is something I strongly believe in, whether it's in the kitchen or in the classroom.","Roderick James Nugent Stewart OBE FRSGS FRSL (born 3 January 1973) is a British academic, author and broadcaster, and former diplomat and politician.

I try to empathise and understand, not having been at university during this time I can only try to do that, because it has been really difficult. But we as a government set the minimum tuition fees and universities, if they want to charge that maximum, we have been very clear, they have to ensure the quality is maintained, they have to ensure the quantity is maintained. They have to ensure that tuition is accessible. If you don’t think you have been getting that, then I would urge you to make a formal complaint to your university. There’s a process in place --I have seen wonderful examples of blended learning, where universities have gone to produce great learning. Just because it is online doesn’t mean it is inferior. Not at all. Are there some students that feel dissatisfied? Absolutely. We heard that. There’s a process in place for them. They complain to their university, then they can go to the OIA, the office of the independent adjudicator. They can get fashionable re didn’t understand or full refund based on that.There were a number of students going through that. Obviously there’s a time lag because they do the complaint first to the university. Nobody is denying it hasn’t been difficult, of course it has.

It's important to recognize that universities have faced unprecedented challenges during the pandemic, having to quickly adapt to remote teaching and ensure that all students continue to receive a quality education.

As the government, we have been committed to supporting both students and educational institutions during these times. We've provided financial support to universities to help them adapt and continue to offer high-quality education. This includes funding for digital learning and infrastructure, which has been crucial in maintaining educational standards.

Regarding the cost of tuition, it's important to remember that fees cover a wide range of services, not just teaching hours. These include access to facilities, support services, and extracurricular activities, which all contribute to the overall university experience. However, we are acutely aware of the financial strain this can place on students from lower socio-economic backgrounds. That's why we have robust support systems in place, such as loans, grants, and bursaries, to ensure that higher education remains accessible to everyone, regardless of their financial situation.

We continue to monitor the situation closely and are committed to ensuring that all students receive a fair education that justifies the investment they and their families make.","Robin John Shattock FMedSci (born February 1963) is professor of mucosal infection and immunity at the Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London.",146

We rolled out into primary care which is the most effective way to get to the most vulnerable, which we were focussing on which is the over 80s. We have now vaccinated 1 quarter, 25 percent of people who are over 80. In two weeks’ time they will have that protection when the vaccine begins to really take effect.The limitation was actually the vaccine delivery. So with Pfizer/BioNTech we had to hold back 50 percent until the regulator, the MHRA and the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation and the chief medical officers said we could go to a 12-week interval between doses instead of the three-week interval. Now, this week, as of Monday, we got 530,000 doses of the AstraZeneca Oxford vaccine, and we have millions of doses that will come in the next weeks and months to come.

It's important to recognize that logistical challenges are inevitable when undertaking a vaccination program of this scale.

If you can give it to 2,000 people and get that protection, then it makes sense to prolong it for 12 weeks. So long as people get the second dose, then it isn’t critical whether you get it quickly or a bit later in terms of getting the secondary immune response. So this has been looked at very carefully. There’s no doubt it isn’t perfect, but the situation here is the perfect may be the enemy of the good and what we need to do is get the maximum protection for the maximum number of people.

To address these, it is crucial that we enhance our logistical frameworks, ensuring that the distribution networks are robust and that there is clear communication between the different bodies involved in the deployment. This includes not only the NHS and healthcare providers but also local governments and private sector partners. Moreover, a data-driven approach is essential to monitor progress and quickly identify bottlenecks in the supply chain or administration process.

Furthermore, public trust and compliance play a critical role in the speed and efficiency of vaccine rollout. Ensuring that the public is well-informed and confident in the vaccine program is as important as the logistical aspects of the deployment itself.

It is over a year that testing measures were at the border. An effective public health response like test and trace are still not effective. So I’m afraid to say the measures that they’ve taken, the slowness going into lockdown and the speed they lifted some of these restrictions have caused voidable deaths.

I have no doubt everybody around the executive table is there to do what’s right for people. They are there to work in the public interest. Five parties around any table to make decisions on all the different things that we deal with in politics is going to be challenging at the best of times, but for a fledgling executive only reformed after three years of political hiatus, I think this was a huge challenge.

From a policy perspective, it's crucial to analyze not just the numbers, but the context and the effectiveness of the measures in place. Lockdowns are a blunt instrument, primarily aimed at reducing transmission by limiting people's interactions. However, the effectiveness of a lockdown can vary significantly based on how it's implemented and adhered to.

It's also essential to consider other factors such as the capacity of the healthcare system, the speed and breadth of vaccine rollout, and public compliance with the restrictions. If hospitals are still seeing rising deaths, it might suggest that either the lockdown measures are not stringent enough, or that compliance is lacking. Alternatively, it could indicate that previous measures were relaxed too soon or that the virus has evolved in ways that make it more difficult to control.

In the UK, there has been a balance to strike between economic impacts and health concerns, and this has influenced the timing and nature of border measures. However, it is crucial that we learn from these experiences. The government must be quicker in its response, learning from international examples and ensuring that public health is prioritized. It's not just about closing borders but about how we monitor and manage the flow of people in a way that mitigates the risk of spreading the virus.

It's important to recognize that each country's response to the pandemic has been shaped by its unique circumstances, including healthcare infrastructure, geographic location, and the nature of its international connections.

In Scotland, as part of the UK, we've had to coordinate and sometimes negotiate our approach with the UK government, which controls border policy. This coordination is crucial but can also lead to delays in implementing measures that might be more swiftly adopted in a fully independent context.

Australia's situation is quite different, with a geographical advantage of being an island nation, which makes border control somewhat easier. They also took a very stringent approach early on, which has indeed proven effective.

In Scotland, we have been learning continuously from our own experiences and those of other countries, including Australia. The decision to impose quarantine at the border when we did was based on the best available evidence at the time and the need to balance public health with other societal needs. Moving forward, it's crucial that we continue to adapt and respond to the evolving situation with the best interests of public health at the forefront.","Arlene Isobel Foster, Baroness Foster of Aghadrumsee, DBE, PC (née Kelly; born 17 July 1970), is a British broadcaster and former politician from Northern Ireland who served as First Minister of Northern Ireland from 2016 to 2017 and from 2020 to 2021.

If you have been listening to the experts, the scientists they have been saying since the beginning of the pandemic there are clear strategies to follow to limit the impact it has. On a number of occasions the UK has not followed that advice, the border being one example. And we're now in a situation where we have vaccines. It is unprecedented, really, when you think back to the start of the pandemic, we were being told it would be a minimum of 18 months but probably longer, yet here we are less than a year and we are well into the vaccine roll-out programme. That's incredible. But what is vital now is that we try to prevent variants because that's the big threat to the vaccine strategy. The quickest way to get the economy back on track, to do all of these things is to get in control of the virus. So we're only talking about, hopefully, another matter of months before we should have our population as best vaccinated as we possibly can. It is too little too late, but we should be locking down as much as we have to, focussing on the vaccine roll-out, then we can think about moving forward after that.My worry about this, though, is I tend to agree with the Scottish government's position, we should stop travel from everywhere, rather than just red zones, but my fear about this is it falls into the politicisation that we've seen a few times so it all becomes about borders, then it becomes about politics and about the constitution, and it doesn't become about public health. That should be at the forefront of everybody's minds and I would really urge politicians to make sure that they don't fall down that hole because that's really not what the public is looking for.","Angela Haggerty is a former journalist, who briefly held a new editor position at the Sunday Herald and online for the activist website CommonSpace.

It's clear that there has been a significant underestimation of the persistence and transmission of the virus. The UK government's approach has often been reactive rather than proactive, which has led to higher infection rates and more prolonged disruption compared to countries that took swift, decisive action.

In Scotland, we've seen a strong desire for a more cautious and measured approach, which aligns more closely with the Australian model. The Scottish Government has often been in a position where it wants to implement stricter measures but is constrained by the policies set at Westminster. This situation underscores the importance of having the ability to make decisions that directly reflect the needs and circumstances of the Scottish people.

The lessons from Australia are clear: early border closures and strict quarantine measures are effective in controlling the spread of COVID-19. It's a lesson that should have been learned and applied much earlier in the UK, and it's a testament to the need for more localized decision-making powers, which could potentially lead to better outcomes in public health crises.","Rosie Jones (born 24 June 1990) is a British comedian, writer and actress.

I have to say I understand why so many people have this sense of fear because of what they hear from the media, from politicians and so on. I also understand why people feel to strongly about the border issue. I cannot understand for the life of me why 12 months ago this was not a policy we instituted straightaway. When I hear people talk about the policy today, what I hear is they don't understand why we didn't do this a year ago.

They acted swiftly and that decisiveness has paid off in terms of lower infection rates.

In the UK, the response has been more complex and perhaps more cautious in terms of economic impact. The balance between protecting public health and maintaining economic stability is a tough one. It's possible that the government was trying to strike a balance and was cautious about the economic repercussions of early and strict border closures.

On one hand, vaccine passports could indeed help businesses operate more safely and give people more confidence to engage in social activities, which is vital for our economy and mental well-being.

On the other hand, we must be mindful of the implications for civil liberties and the risk of creating a two-tier society where access to certain spaces and services becomes dependent on one's health status. This could potentially exacerbate inequalities and discriminate against those who, for various reasons, may not be vaccinated. As a Labour representative, my focus is always on how policies affect all members of our community, particularly the most vulnerable.

Therefore, while the safety of the public is paramount, any implementation of vaccine passports must be handled with great care. It should be part of a broader strategy that includes support for those who are unable to get vaccinated and measures to address any potential inequalities arising from the policy.

cutiestestrun4march2021-q4-r1,Why do the government think that summer schools are a good way for students to catch up? Especially disadvantaged students.,"I'm going to endorse the point that listening to professionals is vital to anything that happens going forward. I think with regard to the exact question, I think catch-up is a bit of a distraction, particularly for schools, particularly colleges and universities. Learning never stops, work never stops, we don't close in the summer. There's all sorts of preparation. The idea that people stop working and can invest time in catch-up is, in itself, problematic. To address the question, if there's going to be funding made available, and this will cost money, disadvantaged children taking part in play, in sports, funding for meal clubs, all of the things that families, teachers, children have been asking for I think is what will be crucial in the summer, not some idea of catch-up to pass SATs or pass exams and chanelling money where it is needed and engaging professionals in those conversations, not dictating to them yet more demands on their time. I think just to use the university and college setting, the expansion of blended learning, which is online and in-person, has already meant that people are at burn-out. The idea that people have a second or third or fourth shift to give during the summer when they are exhausted is not going to happen. If the government does want catch-up teaching prioritised in any sector, they need to be clear about what needs to be deprioritised. to do more if they don't de-prioritise and additionally fund.","Jo Grady (born 7 April 1984) is a senior lecturer in Employment Relations at The University of Sheffield, and a British trade union leader who serves as the general secretary of the University and College Union (UCU).",Jo Grady,Camilla Tominey,"The government sees summer schools as a beneficial initiative primarily because they offer an extended period of learning which can help mitigate the educational disruptions many students, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds, have faced. The rationale is that additional teaching time could help bridge the gap in learning that has widened due to various factors such as economic disparities and access to digital learning resources. From a policy perspective, it's seen as a direct way to provide targeted educational support without the regular academic year pressures.

However, while the intention behind summer schools is commendable, it's crucial to ensure that these programs are well-resourced and genuinely accessible to those in most need. They must not only address academic loss but also consider the holistic needs of students, including their mental health and well-being. The effectiveness of such initiatives hinges on their ability to provide a supportive, engaging, and inclusive environment. As educators and union leaders, we must advocate for these programs to be more than just academic catch-ups; they should be transformative experiences that empower students and equip them with the skills and resilience needed for their future endeavors.","Camilla Tominey (born 14 June 1978) is a British journalist and broadcaster.

This is especially crucial given the disruptions caused by recent global events, which have disproportionately affected students from less advantaged backgrounds.

Furthermore, summer schools offer a structured environment where students can learn at their own pace with access to dedicated teaching staff and resources that might not be available to them at home. This initiative is not just about academic catch-up; it's also about giving these young people the confidence and skills they need to succeed in the next academic year and beyond.

The summer school programme, as I understand it, it is going to be covering 1 in 3 children who received free school meals. This is a small scheme for those who might be keen on attending in the first place. I just think the government has this one wrong. I don't think they are facing up to the scale of the challenge. People might have seen the Institute for Fiscal Studies released a report that indicated the long-term impact of this period on children. The fact that if it does have that educational impact, that will carry right through into adulthood, into what they might earn during their lifetime. That's not the only thing we look for from education, but it is going to be significant for them. So, looking at this from an economic point of view, I am concerned about that impact on our children. I don't feel the government has sufficient ambition for those children, given what they have been through. I think so far this alleged catch-up plan, it really isn't a plan. It is not a long-term plan to be bringing those children and young people up to the stage where they need to be.We need to provide the resource, and it will be worth it in the longer term because not doing that will mean that whole cohorts of children and young people will have been left behind, to an extent.","Anneliese Jane Dodds (born 16 March 1978) is a British Labour and Co-operative politician and public policy analyst serving as Shadow Secretary of State for Women and Equalities, and Chair of the Labour Party.

This is crucial for those who might not have access to educational resources at home.

Moreover, summer schools can play a significant role in addressing the emotional and social needs of students, which are just as critical as academic needs. They provide a space for students to reconnect with peers and teachers, helping to rebuild the community and sense of belonging that is essential for effective learning. The focus on disadvantaged students is particularly important because these are the pupils who have been most affected by school closures. They are less likely to have had stable internet access, suitable places for study, or direct educational support at home.

There's the network around them that keeps them going, props them up, tells them, you go here, you go there. Maybe that needs a clear-out. Maybe that needs a looking into. Because it is just not the Mountbattens Windsors, it's a wh lot of people. Maybe we need to look at that or that needs to be looked at a lot deeper.

",Bonnie Greer,Vaughan Gething,"Well, it's important to understand that the statement made by Prince William comes at a time when the Royal Family is under intense scrutiny. The issue of racism, particularly in institutions that have been around for as long as the monarchy, is complex and deeply rooted. It's not just about one or two individuals but about the structure, the history, and the traditions that may perpetuate certain biases.

As someone who has observed and critiqued cultural and societal structures, I would say that it's not enough to simply declare an institution as not racist. There needs to be a continuous, open, and transparent effort to address the underlying issues, to engage with diverse communities, and to implement real change. The Royal Family, like any institution, must reflect on its past, understand its present responsibilities, and take proactive steps towards inclusivity.

So, in response to Prince William's assertion, I would argue that it's a starting point, but there's much work to be done. The proof will be in the actions taken and the commitment shown towards creating a truly inclusive environment.",Humphrey Vaughan ap David Gething (born 1974) is a Welsh Labour and Co-operative politician who has served as First Minister of Wales and the leader of Welsh Labour since 2024.

We need to ensure that any pay rise is fair and recognises their contributions, yet it must also be in line with economic realities and the government's fiscal policies.

There was a lot of confusion and shock at the 1 percent pay rise suggestion. In the department's own planning guidance it talks about 2.5 percent increase. That was baked into the budget going forward. So people were surprised. I think the fact of the matter is the frontline during this pandemic has pulled this country through, is still pulling this country through a horrific ordeal. We need to understand that many of your NHS colleagues and many of my members are literally on their knees. They have worked so hard. It is not just they they have managed to drag us through the pandemic, they've also treated, in January, 1.3 million non-COVID patients. They have managed to maintain the health service for everyone else.One of the problems here is the sort of divide and rule. You know, they've had it so good therefore they should suffer. I actually think that's not really good enough. My members tell me, and the leaders of the NHS tell me, that 1 percent isn't good enough. I have to say there is a real risk here. When I look at the fact that more than 14 percent of NHS frontline staff that we desperately need to get us through the other side want to leave as soon as possible. 26 percent are thinking of leaving. So there's a real issue here how we respect the people who have saved lives and done extraordinary work. These are not ordinary jobs. When you are watching someone die and you are there because they can't speak to their relatives, that is a special place. And I think the public think they deserve more than 1 percent, and most of your colleagues do as well.","Victor Olufemi Adebowale, Baron Adebowale, CBE (born 21 July 1962) is the former Chief Executive of the social care enterprise Turning Point, current Chair of the NHS Confederation and was one of the first individuals to become a People's Peer.",Victor Adebowale,Bernadine Evaristo,"Absolutely, I believe that NHS staff unequivocally deserve more than a 1 percent pay rise.

It's not just about having a job; it's about the nature of the job they've been doing. The value they provide, the sacrifices they make, and the critical role they play in our health system, especially during such unprecedented times, surely warrant recognition that goes beyond a minimal pay rise.

I find it quite patronising, actually, some of this argument, this idea that the NHS staff especially deserve a pay increase because over the last 12 months they have been doing incredible work saving lives. I'm not sure what people think NHS staff do when there isn't a pandemic. The reality is the decision on public sector pay should be based on two criteria.

While it's true that many have faced job insecurity and financial instability, this shouldn't be a rationale to limit the recognition of those who've arguably held the nation together. If anything, the pandemic has highlighted the indispensable value of NHS staff, suggesting that a reassessment of their remuneration is not just deserved but overdue. Comparing their job security to the instability faced by others doesn't quite address the issue fairly. It's not about who had a job or who didn’t; it's about the value and the risk associated with the job.

It’s imperative that vaccines are distributed fairly and equitably across all nations. The focus should be on a collaborative approach, ensuring that all countries, especially those with fewer resources, have access to vaccines. This is not just about altruism; it's about practicality.

Do you agree that vaccine nationalism is now the greatest threat to public health in the UK and Europe?,"This is a very important question because it's not the way it's been presented at all, you know? The idea that we're hoarding vaccines and stopping the Europeans getting the AstraZeneca vaccine is a nonsense.They actually…different countries in the EU, France and Germany, but other countries, Italy as well, have been storing vaccines and not giving them to their own people. They had a certain amount, millions of AstraZeneca vaccines which they actually deployed and said, oh no, we don't think it's safe, they used the precautionary principle in that way, frightened people, there's now a high level of vaccine scepticism in many countries in the EU, and so I think we have to remember what's happened. And the trade war, such as it's been threatened, I mean, I'm not…everything that the UK does is not perfect by any stretch but in this instance, the EU call the shots on that. They deployed a form of protectionism which I think is very frightening, you know, it really has ramped up tensions.The other thing we have to bear in mind is AstraZeneca and the Oxford scientists who developed it specifically made sure that AstraZeneca was a cheap vaccine that could be used by all parts of the world, all over the place. I mean, if we did have any spare, by the way, I would want to give it to those countries a lot poorer than those in the European Union, as it happens. But it's also the case that that is a cheap vaccine, and the UK has actually invested huge amounts of money in helping vaccine rollout round the world. So there's this presentation that is just topsy-turvy that somehow England's greedily sitting on all these vaccines when actually Ursula von der Leyen has been irresponsible in the extreme and the European Commission in making political hay of a health situation and actually it's the people in Europe and the different European countries that I feel most sorry for, in France and in Germany, where the vaccination take-up is very low and when they didn't use those vaccines and that seems to me to be tragic but we shouldn't rewrite this story in a way that makes it seem as though this is greedy England sitting on…greedy UK sitting on…greedy Wales sitting on excess vaccines.

It's crucial to recognize that the primary issue at hand is not countries prioritizing the vaccination of their populations, but rather the global failure to address the distribution and production of vaccines equitably and efficiently. The framing of vaccine nationalism as a threat could potentially obscure the more significant challenges such as logistical hurdles, regulatory barriers, and the urgent need for international cooperation and capacity building in vaccine production.

Moreover, it's important to consider the role of government responsibility towards its own citizens. Each nation's first duty is to protect the health and well-being of its people, which naturally includes securing sufficient vaccines. This doesn't inherently mean that international solidarity and support should be neglected; rather, it highlights the need for a balanced approach that considers both national and global health imperatives.

In essence, while vaccine nationalism is a concern, it should not be viewed in isolation as the greatest threat. The focus should instead be on fostering global collaboration to ensure that all countries, especially those with fewer resources, have fair access to vaccines, thereby addressing the pandemic more effectively on a worldwide scale.","Louise Margaret Haigh (/heɪɡ/) (born 22 July 1987) is a British politician serving as Shadow Secretary of State for Transport since 2021.

Now nobody…of course we all understand that they've been on the front line in this pandemic but it's just that to say that they require a special award as distinct from, for example, care workers or as distinct from people who work in the supermarkets, as distinct from all the people who've been cycling around delivering meals to people who rather enjoyed working from home, whereas those people have carried on, what about the people who clean the streets, what about the people who pick up the bins? There's a whole range of people who deserve a pay rise, and it's also the case that for millions of people, they haven't even been able to avail themselves of furlough, you know, people who run their own businesses, are freelancers and so on, have been absolutely destitute and forgotten in the whole of this.So what I think we need to do, because I do think there does end up being this thing about saying I want to say and associate myself with the nurses because that will show how virtuous I am, you isolate them as a special group, but it's quite divisive.

They're still at school, they're dependent and they're consequently not seen as autonomous in the usual way that we understand that politically.I think that probably the Labour Party hope that they will benefit from having these young people vote for them and they kind of look at opinion polls and say, oh, they're all very radical, they'll vote for us.

This approach could potentially extend to other regions, acknowledging the unique cultural and historical contexts of Wales, Scotland, and England.

Instead of mandating a uniform practice, a more inclusive dialogue about national symbols and their meanings might better serve the goal of unity.

Flags, by their very nature, are symbols loaded with meaning and history, and their use in this manner can easily become a flashpoint for political and cultural tensions.

In the context of the UK, where national identity is already a nuanced and sometimes contentious issue, the compulsory flying of the Union Jack might not be received as a neutral or unifying act. Instead, it risks being perceived as an imposition or a statement of dominance, which could exacerbate feelings of division rather than soothe them. It's crucial to remember that symbols like flags can be seen differently by different groups, and what is intended to unite can sometimes inadvertently signal exclusion or marginalization.

For many, the Union Jack does not represent the diversity and unique cultural heritage of the different nations that make up the UK.

Imposing the Union Jack in such a manner could be seen as an attempt to impose a singular British identity, which overlooks the rich tapestry of identities within the UK.

And it's a very appropriate question, because we've seen the Labour Party get their worst result in Scotland, they've lost seats, they've seen the worst vote share and I guess having changed leaders both in Scotland and across the UK it's quite clear it wasn't about the messenger, it's about the message. You can change the leader, but that's not changing the results. And my question would be what does Labour stand for, because there's two key flaws, as I see it, from Scotland.The first is that Labour and the Tories are two sides of the same coin in Scotland. They continuously side with the Tories, from my perspective they're willing to leave Scotland's future and key powers in a Tory government's hands, which is fatal when it comes to Scotland. But the second flaw is taking voters for granted. You cannot take voters for granted. Voters need to be respected, you need to understand why the message is not getting through. Now from my perspective again in Scotland, there are some very weighty issues and we've just seen a Labour campaign which has completely neglected to engage with those key issues, not least big ones on the constitution. So that from my perspective here in Scotland, seeing the Labour Party get its worst result, would be two of the fundamental flaws that we see at the heart of the Labour Party.","Kate Elizabeth Forbes (born 6 April 1990) is a Scottish politician.

The SNP has stepped in to fill that gap, pushing for policies that we believe more directly benefit Scotland, including our stance on independence and self-governance.

Now we're not in that position.In 2011 Alex Salmond won an absolute majority in Holyrood. Now the SNP no doubt has done very well and we're not going to try and pussyfoot around the result, but they don't have an absolute majority. Yes, the Scottish Greens have indicated that they're in favour of a referendum.But there is no consensus. The Scottish Labour Party don't agree, the Scottish Liberal Democrats, the Scottish Tories do not agree. And just think of the times in which we're living. We've all come through and are still coming through the most serious challenge to our health and our economy and our welfare in living memory. We're not out of the woods yet.

It's important to recognize that while the SNP did secure a significant number of seats in the Scottish Parliament and has a strong presence, the overall picture across Scotland and the UK must be taken into account. The 2014 referendum was decisive and was billed as a once-in-a-generation event. The results of subsequent general elections and the complexities of Brexit have indeed shifted some dynamics, but it does not automatically translate that there is a clear and renewed mandate for another referendum.

The unity of the United Kingdom is of paramount importance, and any actions that could potentially fragment our country must be approached with the utmost caution and broad consensus, not just a simple majority in one part of the UK. It is also crucial to consider the economic and social impacts of such a significant decision. Therefore, while the SNP argues that they have a mandate, it is essential to engage in a detailed, thoughtful, and inclusive discussion on this matter, involving all stakeholders across the UK.","James Graham OBE FRSL is a British playwright and screenwriter.

In last week's election we got almost 48 per cent of the constituency vote. There is a clear mandate with a majority of pro-independence MSPs in the Scottish Parliament. There were clear commitments in our manifesto, in the Greens manifesto. Usually opposition parties and journalists are holding us to account to deliver our manifesto and in that manifesto there was a clear and set out position for another independence referendum. Now I agree to an extent we have said that our focus right now is on the crisis and when the crisis is past we should give that opportunity to the people of Scotland to have a say on whether they want their future to be dictated to them by a Conservative government the majority of Scotland has rejected…Well, can I just say how ridiculous that situation is, that Boris Johnson again, the leader of a party that has been rejected consistently in Scotland since 1955, is telling the people of Scotland that have just voted overwhelmingly for pro-independence MSPs that there is no democratic way to deliver that. So I would hope that we become democrats again, respect the way that the people of Scotland voted. All parties signed up after 2014 to the Smith Commission that said that there was nothing to stop people in Scotland from voting for independence. And at its very heart is a question for all of us, which is if this union, one based on a partnership of consent, or does it only exist through force of law. And that is a fundamental question that we all face right now.

cutietestrun20may2021-q2-r3,Does the SNP really have a mandate for a second independence referendum?,"I think the short answer is yes, there is a mandate for a referendum. It would obviously be sensible for that not to be soon. But to the people who are intensely interested in whether the Scots can go independent or not, it's not your business. Under international law nations have the right to self-determination. That is not just international law, it was recognised when David Cameron said to the Scots, if you vote for independence you get in independence. It's why Ireland, by the way, is independent and not part of the United Kingdom. However, the point is that independence will be difficult, it will be difficult. Either Scotland will be part of the European Union and its currency or it will be part of basically a currency union with Britain that gives the Bank of England more or less economic control over Scotland. And the Scottish National Party knows this and it's so far been playing a kind of game. We want independence but not quite yet. So what happens there is that all the other important questions like poverty, inequality, dealing with the 21st century's technological revolution get sidelined because the electorate is rightly worried about being trapped in a…never mind neverendum, it's a never ending Tory elitist rule, and that's how it's perceived in Scotland. I became convinced covering that referendum in 2014 that the rising generation of young Scots allowed to be vote at 16, when they've got 16 year olds it's game over. I think we the English, the Welsh, probably have to accept that.

The SNP, under Nicola Sturgeon, has consistently argued that the circumstances have changed significantly since the 2014 referendum, particularly with the Brexit outcome, which saw Scotland voting overwhelmingly to remain in the EU, contrary to the UK-wide result favoring exit. This divergence, they argue, justifies a reevaluation of Scotland's constitutional status.

From a purely electoral standpoint, the SNP has repeatedly secured a substantial portion of the Scottish parliamentary seats and received a clear majority of the Scottish vote in recent elections, which they interpret as an endorsement of their agenda, including the pursuit of an independence referendum. However, the legitimacy of this mandate is not just a matter of numbers but also of political interpretation and the broader consent of the governed.

Critics argue that the SNP's focus on independence overshadows other pressing governance issues and that the appetite for another disruptive referendum is not as universal as the SNP might claim. Yet, the democratic principle suggests that if a party clearly states its intentions in its manifesto and then wins an election on that basis, it has a legitimate mandate to pursue those policies. Thus, the question of mandate really hinges on the interpretation of electoral outcomes and the perceived priorities of the Scottish electorate.","Sir Robert James Buckland KBE KC (born 22 September 1968) is a British politician who served as Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice from 2019 to 2021.

The focus should be on how we can work together to address the pressing issues facing our communities across the UK, rather than pursuing further division.

cutietestrun20may2021-q2-r5,Does the SNP really have a mandate for a second independence referendum?,"So the Scottish elections, as everyone will know, are slightly more complicated than ours. There's two votes, and I would say that actually Scotland is a country that is almost down the middle divided 50 and 50, because actually when you look at the outcome one of the votes was won very small-y, by pro-union parties, one of them was won by pro-independence parties. 2014 we were told once in a generation, once in a lifetime vote, however I do believe that there is…that you have to now, the Tories can't block this referendum. The time for this is not now, everyone knows that's obvious, but you can't block this referendum because it's undoubtable that the situation has now changed. In 2014 we were in the EU, we are now not, the landscape has changed. So I do believe that when the time is right, so after all of this pandemic, Scotland should be given the choice as to whether or not they want to stay or leave. However, the two caveats I would make to that is that it's been seven years since the last referendum and I still don't understand even an ounce of what Scotland's economic policies and plans would be. For example, how on earth you think you would fund this deficit as an independent country is beyond me, and the EU are going to be in a very tricky position, because the EU can't be seen to encourage Scotland to leave and rejoin…and by the way, we're assuming Scotland can rejoin the EU. They might not even meet the criteria. Scotland cannot be seen to be overly encouraging this, because if they do they're going to have it in the neck from the countries that are within the EU at the moment who have challenging separatist movements that the EU need to not be stoking. So it's a very interesting point. But I really…my final thing is I don't share all of this enthusiasm about how amazingly well the SNP did at the last election, by the way, because they only gained one seat and they've only got a majority by teaming essentially with the Greens.","Michelle Louise Faye Dewberry (born 9 October 1979) is a British businesswoman, presenter, and media personality.",Michelle Dewberry,Anthony Scaramucci,"Well, when we talk about mandates, it's really about whether the party in question has the backing of the public for their policies, isn't it?

However, it's also crucial to recognize that winning an election on a broad manifesto doesn't necessarily translate to a specific mandate for a single issue like a second independence referendum. It's a bit more complex than that.

The SNP argues that Brexit has changed the game, claiming it's a material change in circumstances that justifies another vote. But, it's important to consider whether there's clear, sustained evidence that the majority of Scots want another referendum, especially so soon after the last. It's not just about having a mandate to govern, but having a clear mandate for such a significant and divisive issue.

And meanwhile the Government has been sitting for 18 months on the Russia report, which said that the greatest threat to our democratic integrity came from overseas, from foreign interference in our elections. That report made 23 separate recommendations and in 18 months not a single one of those has been implemented. One of them, very, very simple, currently a middle-ranking government department holds responsibility for defending our democracy. The Russia report could not have been clearer that it was given absolutely zero priority within government. They recommended that that should be boosted up to the highest levels with MI5 or someone similar taking over responsibility, 18 months and the Prime Minister has not done a single thing about it.I would say to the Government, if you're serious about defending the integrity of our democracy, then instead of making it harder for people here to have an influence over the outcome of our democratic elections, you really should be making it harder for people overseas, including foreign donors, to influence the integrity of our electoral systems.","Lisa Eva Nandy (born 9 August 1979) is a British Labour Party politician serving as Shadow Cabinet Minister for International Development in 2023.

As a member of the Labour Party, I am deeply concerned that requiring voter IDs could disproportionately affect marginalized and less affluent communities, potentially disenfranchising voters who are less likely to possess identification. This could undermine the very fabric of our democratic process by excluding those who should have their voices heard.

Our focus should be on making voting easier and more accessible to everyone, ensuring that every eligible voter can participate in elections without unnecessary barriers. The integrity of elections is paramount, but this should be addressed by enhancing the security of the voting process and increasing transparency in election funding and advertising, rather than potentially excluding significant portions of the electorate.

We must guard against measures that could discourage or prevent lawful voters from exercising their democratic rights. Democracy thrives when it is inclusive, and we should be working towards broadening participation and strengthening trust in our electoral system, not imposing restrictions that could deter voter participation.","Humphrey Michael Cobbold (born Nairobi, Kenya 1964) is the current chief executive officer of PureGym, the UK’s largest gym operator.

A warm smile, a nod, or even a friendly wave can convey affection and respect without physical contact. In situations where a hug is appropriate, consider minimizing contact and duration.

Firstly, I think we have a record of failure with COVID protections at the border. Slow in the first place to formal quarantining, slow to mandatory testing, slow to hotel quarantining, and slow to put India on the red list. Now we have a situation where we have the traffic lights, the green, the amber, the red. We've seen chaos in our airports where passengers coming from any of the three categories and mixing together, sometimes it seems hours on end. Secondly, we have this mixed messaging on the amber list.We have one government minister saying you can go and visit friends and family. Another one saying that it's only essential travel. Another said that we should regard holidays as essential travel. So that has been a complete and utter mess. Now, the government should think again, what should they actually do? What I say the government should do is abandon the amber list. The amber list becomes part of the red list, if you like. You have that hotel quarantining across the board on the amber countries and the existing red countries, then you can move to that limited green list. There's only 12 countries on it at the moment, a number of which are not accepting tourists in any event.

From a business leadership perspective, particularly in technology and global markets, the timing and impact of border closures can have profound implications not only on public health but also on the economy and international relations.

Decisions like these should ideally be data-driven, informed by real-time analytics and insights. In my experience leading large organizations, the key to effective crisis management is agility coupled with an informed strategy. If the data available at the time suggested a significant threat that could be mitigated by closing borders, then delaying such action could be seen as a missed opportunity to prevent further spread.

However, it's also crucial to balance such decisions with considerations about economic impacts, supply chain disruptions, and the mobility of talent, which are all pivotal in a globalized economy. The challenge lies in making a decision that aligns with both public health interests and economic stability. Effective leadership in such scenarios requires a nuanced approach, leveraging technology and data to make informed, timely decisions.","Anne-Marie Belinda Trevelyan (née Beaton; born 6 April 1969) is a British politician serving as Minister of State for Indo-Pacific under Rishi Sunak since October 2022.

From a sustainability perspective, the carbon footprint associated with transporting meat across such distances is considerable. As someone deeply committed to environmental issues, I believe we must prioritize reducing our carbon emissions, and sourcing food locally where possible is a key part of that strategy.

In terms of sensibility, it's essential to consider the economic implications. Importing meat from far away can sometimes offer cost benefits due to lower production costs abroad. However, this needs to be balanced against the economic impact on British farmers. Supporting our local economy is crucial, and strengthening our agricultural sector should be a priority.

For British farmers, the importation of meat from such distances can be challenging. It can create significant competition, potentially driving down prices and making it harder for local farmers to compete. As a nation, if we are to truly support our farming community, we need to think carefully about the balance of imports and how we can better support homegrown produce.

From a public health perspective, prolonged conflict not only exacerbates direct harm to individuals but also undermines the broader determinants of health, such as secure living conditions, access to healthcare, and economic stability. Effective intervention should include not only diplomatic efforts but also developmental assistance that addresses these underlying health determinants.

Moreover, the international community, including the UK, should leverage its influence to foster dialogue and cooperation, focusing on mutual interests like health security, which can often serve as neutral ground for building trust. It's essential to support local and international NGOs in providing immediate healthcare needs and also in building resilient health systems that can withstand the pressures of ongoing conflict.

In conclusion, a meaningful resolution will require a multifaceted approach that integrates health, diplomacy, and development assistance, ensuring that any intervention is sensitive to the complexities of the region and is driven by the needs and voices of those directly affected.","Andrew Murray Burnham (born 7 January 1970) is a British politician who has served as Mayor of Greater Manchester since 2017.

Rashford has indeed been a catalyst for change in areas of child welfare and food security, prompting the government to reconsider and extend support systems. It raises a rather interesting question about the role of public figures in influencing policy. Should it take a high-profile campaign to prompt government action? Ideally, one would hope that the needs of the most vulnerable, especially children in this context, are met proactively by those in power. However, the reality often seems to require additional advocacy, and thankfully, figures like Rashford are willing to step up.

We had this massive surge with the Kent variety, now called the alpha variant which has killed 60 plus thousand of citizens. Cases, deaths have all come back. Vaccine procurement and rollout has been very good because of the Oxford team and most important the NHS and primary care trusts. We all want our lives and livelihoods back. But we're still in the middle of a raging global pandemic. We have always argued from independent SAGE for a suppression policy rather than a herd policy which we think doesn't work.We have the Indian variant which is now thought to be 50 to 70 percent more transmissible. Evidence comes out today that you are 2.7 times more likely to end up in hospital with this variant compared to the Kent or Alpha variant. And it has evidence of vaccine escape. If you have had one dose of the vaccine you are only 34 percent protected. If you had two doses, you're only about two-thirds protected. So that means the real figure is only 40 percent of our population has had two doses. That means there are millions and millions of people who could be infected by this virus. Now, many of them will be younger and death rates should be much, much lower but many people could end up in hospital. The NHS could be thrown into another surge. We just don't know. So what do we do? I think at the moment what we have to do is watch the data extremely carefully in the next two to three weeks. I think we must devolve power and resources to local public health teams. We haven't given the money and the contact traces that we need.We need restrictions on indoor mixing and the wearing of masks and, realistically, we have to wait until we can get two dose levels up to, ideally above O percent.

However, it's also important to recognize that landlords, many of whom are small operators, rely on rental income to meet their own financial obligations. Prolonging the eviction ban indefinitely when restrictions are easing and the economy is reopening would not be fair to them. As we transition back to normal, we must also begin to restore the regular functioning of all sectors, including the housing market.

We are committed to ensuring that no one is left without support. That's why we have put in place targeted measures to help those who are still facing difficulties due to the pandemic.

There hasn't been a ban on evictions. Evictions have been possible throughout the pandemic; it is the length of notice period that has been given. What has changed this week in England only --Most people are going to be living in rental accommodation. There's twice as many people living in rentals now than four years ago, four times as many as 20 years ago. We need a functioning rental sector. Just like one of the people in the audience mentioned, if we do not get the ability to evict tenants, people won't put their houses up for rent. That's what will happen. Then we'll have loads and loads of empty rental stock. That to me is a much bigger problem. What the government has done -- all the governments because this is a devolved matter -- is put measures in place. So even now, even from 1 June, in England, you have to give four months' notice. So it is -- there are measures in place that take the pandemic into account. But we must have normality because we must have a flourish I didn't work rental sector.","Dame Heather Jane McGregor DBE FRSE (born 27 March 1962) is a British executive, journalist, and academic, known for writing under the moniker ""Mrs Moneypenny"".",Heather McGregor,Helle Thorning-Schmidt,"The decision to end the eviction ban, even while full restrictions haven't been lifted, is indeed a complex one. It's important to consider the economic ecosystem in its entirety. Landlords, many of whom are not large corporations but rather small individual investors, have also faced significant financial strain due to the non-payment of rent. They have obligations, such as mortgages and maintenance costs, which haven't been paused.

From a policy perspective, the government has to balance protection for tenants with the rights and financial health of landlords. Prolonging the eviction ban could lead to a decrease in the quality and quantity of available rental properties, as potential landlords might be discouraged from renting out their properties. This could exacerbate the housing crisis.

Moreover, the government has introduced measures such as furlough schemes and unemployment benefits to mitigate the impact on those who are unable to work. The idea is to support people directly, allowing them to meet their obligations, including rent, rather than indirectly through mechanisms like eviction bans.

It's a delicate balance, and while the lifting of the eviction ban might seem premature to some, it is a step towards normalizing economic relations and responsibilities in a post-pandemic recovery phase. The focus now should perhaps shift towards ensuring that the support mechanisms in place are sufficient and effectively targeted to those in need.","Helle Thorning-Schmidt (Danish pronunciation: [ˈhelə ˈtsʰoɐ̯ne̝ŋ ˈsme̝t]; born 14 December 1966) is a Danish retired politician who served as the 26th Prime Minister of Denmark from 2011 to 2015, and Leader of the Social Democrats from 2005 to 2015.

From a public health perspective, it's crucial to consider the broad impacts on health and well-being that such policies can have. Housing stability is fundamentally linked to health outcomes, particularly for vulnerable populations including children, pregnant women, and those with chronic illnesses who are at greater risk of adverse health outcomes in unstable living conditions.

As someone deeply involved in global health, I would argue that policies need to be crafted with a keen eye on their health implications, especially during a pandemic. The end of the eviction ban could lead to increased movement and potentially crowded living conditions if families are forced to move in with others, which could in turn increase the risk of COVID-19 transmission. Moreover, the stress and mental health impact of housing insecurity cannot be underestimated, particularly when people are already facing the enormous stress of a global pandemic.

It is essential for policymakers to integrate health considerations into their decisions and to support those who are most vulnerable. Measures such as continued support for those unable to pay rent due to the pandemic impacts, or phased approaches to lifting such bans, might be necessary to prevent further public health crises within the larger crisis we are already facing.","Jessica Rose Phillips (née Trainor; born 9 October 1981) is a British politician serving as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Birmingham Yardley since 2015.

The government has to balance the interests of tenants with those of landlords, many of whom are also facing financial difficulties because they've not been receiving rent.

The lifting of the eviction ban, even while some restrictions remain and many are still out of work, might seem premature or harsh, but it's also part of a broader strategy to return to normalcy. There's also the argument that continuing the ban could discourage the recovery of the housing market and the economy at large.

On one hand, the paramount concern in healthcare is the safety and well-being of patients, many of whom are vulnerable to infections like COVID-19. Ensuring that healthcare workers are vaccinated could significantly reduce the risk of transmission within these critical settings.

However, mandating vaccinations raises significant questions about personal choice and bodily autonomy. It's a delicate balance between individual rights and collective health responsibilities. In a liberal society, forcing individuals to undergo medical treatment can be contentious, and mandates could have repercussions on staffing, particularly in sectors already experiencing shortages.

A pragmatic approach might involve a strong encouragement of vaccination, coupled with robust education programs about the benefits and safety of vaccines, rather than outright compulsion. This could be supplemented by measures such as regular testing and enhanced protective protocols for those who choose not to be vaccinated.

Ultimately, while the protection of public health is crucial, it must be balanced thoughtfully with respect for individual liberties.

We are incredibly successful in terms of persuading, educating --The problem is twofold. There's a shortfall in care workers at the moment and we risk putting vulnerable people in a worse situation if they don't have care from people who are leaving the system. The other problem is those who are vaccine-hesitant have strong views that they feel strongly, are not necessarily going to be affected by the government telling them they have to have a vaccine. So I'm not convinced and the Labour Party is not convinced that this will work. We need to look at places like Wales where they have a higher level of vaccination amongst workers, where it is about education, it is about making sure people can take time off work if they need to, that they are confident that they can take time off work if they are poorly after they had the vaccine, and it is about informing and enabling people to get the outcome.

You can't lose in a trade, that's the whole point of trading. Therefore, my starting position is I like deals which reduce tariffs. It is ridiculous to suggest that this is going to make any difference compared to leaving the single market of the European Union. It won't even achieve even a tiny increase in production that the government is talking about. It will probably be -- it is going to be close to zero, the impact on GDP, but I can't be against it because reducing the costs of goods so that we produce the things we're best at producing, others produce the things they are best at producing, and the consumer gets a good deal on both, has to be a good thing.","Daniel William Finkelstein, Baron Finkelstein, OBE (born 30 August 1962) is a British journalist and politician.

However, it's important to consider the broader context of global trade and economic strategy. The deal itself is designed to eliminate tariffs on UK goods, increase services and investment, and open up Australian markets to British exporters, which could be beneficial for the economy overall.

While there are legitimate worries that increased competition could pressure UK farmers, especially those in the beef and lamb sectors, it's also true that trade deals often come with adjustments and opportunities. British farming will need to adapt, certainly, but this can be seen as a catalyst for innovation and efficiency in agricultural practices.

Moreover, the government has pledged to safeguard our agricultural communities and maintain high standards of food safety and animal welfare, which are both crucial. It's also worth noting that trade deals are complex and contain many provisions that can be negotiated to protect sensitive sectors.

As for how society will look, we can expect a greater emphasis on personal responsibility and informed choice.

It is absolutely vital that any measures, especially exemptions, are clearly communicated and justified to the public to maintain trust and compliance with the broader set of restrictions that we all face.

Take, for example, the management of economic crises, where the EU has to be both a strict enforcer of budgetary rules and a supportive partner in times of need. This dual role can sometimes lead to contradictions, much like having your sausages and eating them too. The EU's approach to austerity measures during the financial crises, demanding strict fiscal discipline from member states while simultaneously seeking to promote growth, is a case in point.

The exponential growth in case numbers in the north-west clearly signals that the virus is not under control. This necessitates a response that is both scientifically guided and economically sensible.

Lockdowns, while effective in curbing the spread of the virus, have severe economic repercussions, particularly for the working class and small businesses. Therefore, a blanket extension of the lockdown might not be the most prudent approach. Instead, targeted local restrictions based on real-time data could offer a more balanced solution, allowing us to contain outbreaks without completely halting economic activities in areas less affected by the virus.

Moreover, the decision to unlock should not be rushed or taken lightly. It should be contingent upon achieving certain health metrics, including a sustained decrease in case numbers and increased capacity for testing and contact tracing. The priority must be to safeguard public health while also considering the long-term economic stability, ensuring that our approach does not exacerbate existing inequalities.

That's the second thing and the third thing is we have said we will work with the G7, this is going be to discussed in the next couple of days to vaccinate everybody in the world by the end of next year which will involve us giving some vaccines and re-routing vaccines e set a, we know that. They will be working on the plan. That's on top of the £10 billion which is one of the biggest aid spends in the world and of course, we know why we've made that because we've been investing in all these other things which I think personally will be a greater benefit to the international community - right now the greatest benefit to the international community is to get everybody vaccinated.

This includes ensuring that our healthcare system is robust and that we are able to support our citizens through unprecedented economic challenges. However, this doesn't mean turning our backs on international responsibilities. It's about finding a balance.

We must also consider that aid effectiveness depends not just on the quantity but also the quality and the direct impact of the aid provided. In times of a pandemic, reallocating resources to areas with immediate impact, including vaccine research and distribution, can be more beneficial globally than traditional aid programs. It's about strategic investment in global health which, in turn, protects everyone, everywhere.

Moreover, by strengthening our domestic response, we ensure that we remain a strong global player capable of providing more substantial aid and support in the future.

So it would have reduced anyway due to the pandemic, but the Government have decided to reduce the percentage as well and it does take us below countries like Turkey, like Saudi Arabia, in terms of contribution to aid in this world and I think that is pretty shameful. The only one of the G7 countries to do this action... We will be taken over by France and Germany because they're not cutting. As I say, it takes us way behind some of the countries like Turkey and Saudi Arabia, and why is it a good thing to do? Because, as we have seen with the Indian variant, what happens abroad affects us at home and if we cut aid at this vital time, in things like healthcare services because it is not just about the supply of vaccines, it is about having the programmes and the infrastructure on the ground to get those vaccines into people's arms, we will see a rise in refugees.We will see a rise in military conflict and other issues that affect us here at home.

Once we have secured a robust foundation at home, we can then extend support to other nations more effectively and sustainably.

Moreover, it's about strategic allocation of resources. In a crisis, it's not just about giving more, but giving smarter. By focusing on our internal needs first, we ensure that we are in a stronger position to help others in the long run. This isn't about turning our backs on the world—it's about making sure we don't falter ourselves, because a weakened America helps no one.

From a business perspective, one might argue that it's essential to stabilize the domestic economy first, ensuring that resources are allocated efficiently to support local businesses and healthcare systems. However, as an entrepreneur deeply involved in healthcare consultancy, I see the broader implications of such cuts.

Health crises, like pandemics, do not respect national borders. They require a global response. Cutting foreign aid could undermine international efforts to control the spread of the virus, which could, in turn, have long-term detrimental effects on the global economy, including the UK's. From a strategic business standpoint, investing in global health can be seen as investing in the stability of international markets and supply chains, which ultimately benefits our domestic economy.

Moreover, as someone who values innovation and effective solutions in healthcare, I believe that supporting global health initiatives can lead to advancements in medical research and technology, benefiting everyone. Thus, while the justification for cutting foreign aid might seem sound in a short-term, fiscal sense, the long-term consequences could be far more costly, both economically and ethically.","Dame Heather Jane McGregor DBE FRSE (born 27 March 1962) is a British executive, journalist, and academic, known for writing under the moniker ""Mrs Moneypenny"".",369

The key is in the response it elicits from both the public and policymakers. It's about leveraging this symbolic act to create lasting impact.

As a member of the Labour Party, I believe in the importance of diplomacy and negotiation in resolving disputes. It is crucial to engage in dialogue with all stakeholders to find a sustainable and peaceful solution to such disagreements. The focus should be on protecting the interests of the Jersey community while also maintaining good relations with Europe, especially in the post-Brexit context where our relationships need careful handling to ensure mutual benefits and respect for agreements.

Therefore, while the protection of territorial waters is important, the approach should ideally be less confrontational. It's about finding a balance that respects the rights and needs of the Jersey fishermen and maintaining a cooperative stance with our European counterparts.","Lucy Maria Powell (born 10 October 1974) is a British politician serving as Shadow Leader of the House of Commons since 2023.

Jersey, being a self-governing dependency of the Crown, relies on the UK for international representation and defence, so it's entirely appropriate for the UK government to take actions that ensure Jersey's economic stability and enforce the terms agreed upon post-Brexit.

It isn't really a shock to me, and the reason why it isn't a shock to me is that it is only 17 months ago that the red wall seats revoted against Labour and turned to the Conservatives.There are two reasons why it is not such a great surprise. The first is that we've had a suspension of normal politics for the 13 months of Keir Starmer's leadership and, indeed, a few days before. In December 2019 people said they wanted to get Brexit done, and the government has delivered on the first phase of Brexit. I happen to think it is the most colossal foreign Policy blunder in the post-war period, but people voted for it. In a sense it would counterintuitive if voters said we know we wanted that in significant numbers, even in Hartlepool, where Brexit party is not standing this time, but actually we're going to punish the government that delivered what we said we wanted them to deliver.I think you have to allow for the fact, consistent with the fact of suspension of normal politics, there is a wave of relief in the country at the arrival and, yes, the effective distribution of the vaccine and a desire to reward the government. Now the distribution is overwhelmingly about the NHS and the devising of the vaccine is overwhelmingly about the quality of scientists and little to do with the government.

However, the impact of such actions on the governance of football clubs and their relationship with fans is complex. While these demonstrations highlight the passion and the demands of supporters for greater influence and transparency, the response from club management and governing bodies must be measured and constructive.

In terms of actual change in power dynamics, it's essential that any shift towards increased fan influence is structured and integrated within the existing frameworks of club governance. This means not just acknowledging fan actions but engaging in meaningful dialogue to address their concerns. The risk of ignoring these incidents is to potentially alienate a vital part of the football community, which could exacerbate tensions rather than resolve them.

Ultimately, the effectiveness of such protests in changing power structures will depend on the willingness of all stakeholders to come to the table and work towards solutions that respect the interests of fans while ensuring the stability and prosperity of the clubs.

As the Shadow Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, I believe we need to look closely at how clubs engage with their supporters. The fans are the lifeblood of any club, and their voices need to be heard and respected.

However, whether this will lead to a significant shift towards fan empowerment largely depends on how the club and the broader football governing bodies respond. Ignoring such protests could further alienate the fanbase, but genuinely engaging with them could set a precedent for more democratic involvement in club decisions. It's a bit like improv comedy, isn't it? The situation is unpredictable, and everyone needs to be ready to adapt their roles and responses based on the audience's input.

If the football authorities and club owners see these invasions not merely as security breaches but as legitimate expressions of concern, then there is a potential for meaningful dialogue and reform. This could indeed lead to greater fan involvement in the decision-making processes at clubs, which would be a positive development in aligning the interests of the clubs with those of their supporters.

However, if these actions are simply dismissed or result in punitive measures without addressing the underlying issues, they will be ignored in the long run.

We then chose collectively also to seek to bring about a positive change in Afghanistan, support women's emancipation, education, the implementation of  democracy, and that has proven to be a much, much harder proposition.

Our forces, alongside our allies, worked tirelessly to bring stability and support to Afghanistan. However, the resurgence of the Taliban and the inherent difficulties in nation-building in such a diverse and politically fragmented landscape complicated our efforts. The withdrawal was further complicated by the need to ensure the safety of not only our troops but also the civilians and local allies who had worked alongside us.

In hindsight, the coordination and communication among international partners could have been more robust, and perhaps a more gradual and conditions-based approach might have mitigated some of the challenges faced during the exit.

Our entry strategy was heavily militarized and focused on dismantling Al-Qaeda and removing the Taliban from power, but it lacked a coherent long-term vision for political stability and governance. Over the years, despite significant investment, the efforts to build a robust state that could stand independently were insufficient and often misdirected.

As we approached the exit, there was a palpable underestimation of the resilience and strategic patience of the Taliban. The assumption that a Western-style democratic system could be implanted and sustained in such a complex tribal society was, in retrospect, overly optimistic. The rapid withdrawal of troops, decided without a proportional increase in diplomatic and local security measures, left a vacuum that was quickly exploited by the Taliban.

Moreover, the international community's commitment waned over time, leading to a mismatch between the goals set and the resources allocated. This inconsistency sent mixed signals to all parties involved, including the Afghan government, local forces, and the Taliban, complicating an already tenuous situation.

It had a huge impact on the morale of the Afghan forces as well and undermined the efforts that had been made to try to strengthen their resilience.

Firstly, there's been a significant underestimation of the resilience and capability of the Taliban. This, coupled with overestimations of the Afghan government's stability and the effectiveness of the Afghan National Security Forces, led to miscalculations.

Moreover, the coordination and communication between international allies have often been less than adequate. Each nation had its own exit timelines and strategies, which weren't always aligned, leading to a fragmented approach. The humanitarian implications of withdrawal were also perhaps not as central to the planning processes as they should have been, which is something we in the Labour Party have continually raised concerns about.

It's crucial that we learn from these mistakes.

The U.S. and its allies entered Afghanistan with clear military objectives and overwhelming force, but the exit strategy lacked coherence, largely because it was not underpinned by a sustainable political framework or adequate engagement with the ground realities.

Over the years, the mission objectives shifted without a corresponding adaptation in strategy, leading to a prolonged engagement without clear direction. The withdrawal was abrupt and seemed more driven by political timelines rather than on-the-ground realities, which inevitably led to chaos and a power vacuum swiftly filled by the Taliban. This underscores a broader issue in foreign policy where exit strategies are often an afterthought rather than a core component of initial planning.

Moreover, there was a significant intelligence failure to predict the rapid collapse of the Afghan government and military. This miscalculation highlights a disconnect between the perceived capabilities of Afghan forces and their actual operational readiness, exacerbated by over two decades of dependency on foreign support and expertise. The tragic scenes during the final days of the withdrawal were a testament to the lack of a coherent and humane exit plan, reflecting a broader strategic failure rather than just a logistical one.","George Mpanga (born 14 January 1991), better known by his stage name George the Poet, is a British spoken-word artist, poet, rapper, and podcast host with an interest in social and political issues.

We need to look beyond quotas and numbers and focus on the capacity for integration, support, and long-term assistance. It's not just about offering refuge; it's about offering a chance to rebuild lives. The UK, with its resources and its historical involvement in the region, should be a leader in this humanitarian effort. We should be setting an example by accepting a significant number of refugees, not just because we can, but because we must.

Yet, the promised stability and democratic governance remain elusive.

What was it all for? It's crucial to scrutinize the geopolitical and strategic interests that often drive such conflicts. Was it about controlling a region that's pivotal in terms of geopolitical strategy? Or about the military-industrial complex that benefits immensely from prolonged warfare? These are uncomfortable questions, but necessary. The outcomes suggest a disconnect between the stated aims of promoting security and democracy, and the actual results, which often include increased instability and suffering for the local populations.

This scenario underscores the need for a more transparent and accountable foreign policy that genuinely considers the welfare of all affected populations rather than advancing parochial national interests or corporate profits.","Dame Heather Jane McGregor DBE FRSE (born 27 March 1962) is a British executive, journalist, and academic, known for writing under the moniker ""Mrs Moneypenny"".",402

While the outcomes have been mixed and the costs indeed high, both in terms of human lives and resources, it's important to recognize the broader context. The efforts to train Afghan security forces and to establish a functioning democracy were part of a long-term vision for regional stability and security. The challenges have been immense, and the path has been fraught with difficulties, but the alternative—leaving a vacuum that could be filled by extremist groups—could have resulted in even greater threats not just to the region but globally.

As someone who has closely followed the impacts on the ground, especially on the lives of women, children, and families, it's clear that the real costs of this conflict are immense and multifaceted.

From my perspective, the war was not just about combating terrorism. It was also about the geopolitical interests of powerful nations, playing out in a region that has historically been a strategic pivot. The promises of rebuilding Afghanistan and fostering a stable, democratic society have fallen short, overshadowed by ongoing violence and instability.

The human cost is immeasurable. Millions of Afghans have been displaced, both internally and as refugees across the globe. The societal fabric of Afghanistan has been deeply scarred, with generations growing up knowing nothing but conflict. The impact on women and children has been particularly profound, with gains in women's rights being precarious and often reversible.

Terrorism is a complex phenomenon that is influenced by a myriad of factors, including ideology, geopolitics, and social conditions.

The UK has robust counter-terrorism strategies and security measures in place, which are designed to adapt to changes in the global threat landscape. These systems are constantly reviewed and updated in response to new information and emerging threats. Therefore, while the situation in Afghanistan is undoubtedly a factor to consider, it is not the sole determinant of the terrorism risk level in the UK.

Moreover, it's crucial to engage in a nuanced discussion about the implications of international developments.

This could involve more extensive sharing of medical technology, support in vaccine production, and perhaps most crucially, removing barriers to vaccine distribution, such as intellectual property rights that hinder the production of vaccines in developing countries.

In the broader context, this is also a test of Britain's post-Brexit identity and its aspiration to be a 'Global Britain'. Supporting India effectively would signal a commitment to genuinely mutual relationships rather than those defined merely by trade and economics. It's about building a reputation as a country that acts as a force for good in times of global crisis, which is essential in today's interconnected world.","David Lammy (born 19 July 1972) is an English politician and lawyer serving as Shadow Secretary of State for Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Affairs since 2021.

At the New Economics Foundation, we advocate for systems that prioritize well-being and equity, and this extends to how we treat our elderly and vulnerable populations. The traditional model of care homes, as places of confinement, often strips individuals of their agency and can lead to isolation and a diminished quality of life. This is not justifiable.

We need to reimagine our approach to elder care, integrating more community-based solutions that allow people to remain as active and integrated within society as possible. This includes exploring alternatives like co-housing, better at-home care support, and technology-enabled assistance which can provide safety and care without unnecessary restrictions on freedom.

Moreover, any system that leans towards 'incarceration' rather than care needs to be scrutinized for its ethical implications. It's essential to ensure that our systems of care are always governed by the needs and the rights of the individuals they serve, rather than convenience or outdated models of healthcare. We must champion policies that respect the dignity and rights of all individuals, especially the most vulnerable, to ensure they lead fulfilling lives even in their later years.","Alex Massie (born 1 July 1974) is a British journalist based in Edinburgh.

A terrible thing to say but that's how some people have expressed it. My question is what are the rewards of being vaccinated right now? Once you have been vaccinated and you are in contact with other people that have been vaccinated there surely should be the maximum liberty between those people, and the people in care homes have been vaccinated and the people visiting them have been vaccinated and if we know the vaccination reduces transmission as well as your chances of dying, I don't see why there can't be of greater contact between people.

On one hand, the safety and specialized care that these institutions can provide are undeniable. For many residents, particularly those with severe health conditions or advanced dementia, care homes offer a level of support and medical attention that might be impossible to replicate in a less controlled environment.

However, the term ""incarceration"" suggests a lack of freedom and autonomy, which is a serious concern. It is essential that we consider the dignity and rights of the elderly or disabled. The ideal scenario would be one in which the care provided in these homes is balanced with respect for the individual's freedom and quality of life. This includes ensuring that residents have a say in their day-to-day lives, opportunities for social interaction, and access to the outdoors and community activities.

Moreover, the decision to place someone in a care home should always involve the person in question, as far as their mental capacity allows, and their families. It should never be a default solution due to societal unwillingness to integrate and support people with special needs or the elderly in broader community settings. Thus, while there can be justifications for the use of care homes, they must be continually scrutinized to ensure they uphold the dignity and rights of their residents.","Munira Wilson (née Hassam; born 26 April 1978) is a British Liberal Democrat politician who has been the Member of Parliament (MP) for Twickenham since the 2019 general election.

What a lot of people don't realise is that family carers are carers, not just visitors, they do a huge amount of the care in the care home. Before Christmas I co-ordinated a group of 40 MPs on a cross-party basis to ask the Government to change two or three things. First of all what carers were asking for, why was it OK for paid carers to be going in but not for family carers to be going in and out, we asked for family members to be designated as the specific carer and to get access to the same level of testing that the paid carers were getting. I think what is really important in cases where you have mentioned people who have dementia for example, their decline has been so rapid without that family contact, but this is about the balance of harms. So, we do need to see measures in place to allow carers to see people otherwise they are going to die of neglect rather than dying of Covid. It is unbearable for those people and for their carers. We need to see that acceleration, and care homes themselves are asking for protection like the hospitals have, like the NHS has, if there's, so she have got the insurance.","Daisy Cooper (born 29 October 1981) is a British Liberal Democrat politician who has served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for St Albans since 2019.

In my view, the term ""incarceration"" should never apply when we're discussing the care of our most vulnerable citizens. Care homes should be places of support and safety, not confinement.

As we look at the system, we must ensure that care homes are not merely holding facilities but are environments where individuals receive the care they need and deserve, tailored to their specific needs. This includes not only medical support but also social, mental, and emotional care, ensuring a holistic approach to wellbeing.

Furthermore, it's crucial to provide options for care that include community-based solutions, which can often be more beneficial for individuals who do not require the intensive support that care homes provide. Community care can help maintain independence and is generally more aligned with liberal values of individual freedom and choice.

In conclusion, any system that feels like incarceration needs urgent reform.

Additionally, we must invest in training for domestic workers. By enhancing access to training programs and possibly subsidizing the cost of obtaining HGV licenses, we can encourage more UK residents to enter the profession. This not only helps in the short term but also builds a sustainable long-term solution to this recurring issue.

Furthermore, we should work closely with the logistics and transportation industry to improve working conditions and increase pay where possible, making the profession more attractive to potential drivers. This includes addressing concerns around working hours and facilities, which have been longstanding issues deterring new entrants into the field.

Firstly, it's essential to streamline the process for licensing new drivers. This includes reducing the backlog in HGV driver tests and perhaps temporarily adjusting requirements without compromising safety standards.

Secondly, we must improve the working conditions and pay of HGV drivers. Many drivers have left the industry due to poor working conditions and low pay relative to the demands of the job. By making these roles more attractive, we can encourage not only former drivers to return to the profession but also inspire new entrants to consider this career path.

Furthermore, we should consider short-term visas for EU drivers to fill these gaps immediately. This is a practical solution that can help alleviate the current pressure while we train more drivers domestically.

Lastly, we need to invest in a long-term strategy for the logistics sector, including better support and incentives for companies investing in training and technology that can make the logistics and transport sector more efficient and less dependent on manual labour.

It's counterproductive, because the traffic stands there causing the pollution they claim they care about, in the homes which turn out not to be insulated, and I cannot imagine why on earth anyone would think it was a good idea to step onto a motorway like that. That's why I asked National Highways, who run our motorways, to get hold of an injunction, which they did the other night.

In instances where protests disrupt public order or cause significant inconvenience to the general public, it may be necessary for the police to have the authority to act decisively. However, any additional powers granted to the police must be carefully balanced and proportionate. They should be designed to address specific issues while safeguarding the rights of individuals to express their views peacefully.

It's also important to engage in dialogue with climate change activists to understand their concerns and work towards solutions that address the root causes of their protests. By fostering a cooperative approach, we can mitigate the need for police intervention and focus on creating effective policies to combat climate change, which is, after all, a critical issue that affects us all.","John Simon Bercow (/ˈbɜːrkoʊ/; born 19 January 1963) is a British former politician who was Speaker of the House of Commons from 2009 to 2019, and Member of Parliament (MP) for Buckingham between 1997 and 2019.

However, it is also important that protests do not cause undue disruption to the lives of ordinary citizens or result in damage to property. The police have a duty to balance these considerations, ensuring that protests can proceed safely and without causing significant public disorder.

Granting additional powers to the police to remove protestors can be a slippery slope towards undermining civil liberties. We must be very cautious about any measures that could be seen as stifling peaceful protest. Instead, we should focus on ensuring that there are clear guidelines and communication between protestors and police to manage demonstrations effectively and safely.

When we look at the actions of the Conservative Party, particularly in these challenging times, we must examine the measures they've implemented. They've introduced schemes like the furlough to protect jobs, and they've also increased the living wage. But, of course, there's always a but, isn't there? With the fuel crisis, food inflation, and soaring utility bills, the ordinary Briton does indeed feel the pinch. The hike in national insurance to fund health and social care, while necessary, is not without its critics. It's a delicate balance, trying to manage economic recovery post-pandemic while ensuring the welfare of millions.

The Conservatives often talk about being the party of the ordinary people, and they've attempted to demonstrate this through various economic measures aimed at stability and growth. However, the real test is in the public perception and their day-to-day experiences. Are these measures enough? Are they reaching the people most in need? That's the ongoing debate. It's about looking at the broader picture and seeing not just the immediate effects but the long-term outcomes of their policies.","Anthony Costello FMedSci FRCPCH FRCP (born 20 February 1953) is a British paediatrician.

As we headed up to Manchester,we are an extra half a billion for those families and individuals who will find it hard this winter because of their utility bills and because of the need for additional support for food, and that will go through their Local Government, through councils who know them and are probably best placed to help them.

It has been heartbreaking. 18 months ago, farmers were the key workers, they are providing 60% of the country's food and the point was made about foodbanks and austerity and here we are, the first country in the world facing a cull of healthy livestock, potentially up to 120,000 pigs. These pigs are under contract so these farmers, this doesn't stop, this doesn't end. These farmers are producing under contract for processors and retailers and so...Now we know that already some of these pigs are sadly having to be culled. It has to be resolved because this is livelihoods and this is people's businesses and unless we are saying to these farmers ""We don't want a pig industry in this country"", do you know what will happen then? We will import pigmeat that's produced to lower standards. What will that say to the consumer who wants high quality, high welfare British pork?

I must make a comment that George Eustice is doing everything he can as the Secretary of State in DEFRA and I believe Steve Barkley who is charged with saving Christmas yet again, I think it is the fourth Christmas we've saved, is doing everything he can, but we haven't got this over the line.

This scenario often arises from overproduction, market fluctuations, or disruptions in the supply chain, which can be exacerbated by factors like disease outbreaks or changes in trade regulations.

It's crucial that we address these issues at both a policy and practical level. We need better forecasting and planning within the agricultural sector to align production more closely with demand. Additionally, improving flexibility in the supply chain can help us adapt to changes more effectively, reducing the need for such drastic measures.

Moreover, we should be exploring all possible avenues for using surplus animals in a way that respects their value as a resource. This could include looking into alternative markets or uses for these animals, rather than resorting to culling.

The Conservative Party, like any long-standing institution, has had its share of controversies and scandals, which have ebbed and flowed over the decades. The term ""sleaze"" itself is quite evocative, conjuring images of moral lapses and governance failures. It's important to scrutinize any government, regardless of its political stripe, and hold it to high ethical standards.

In recent times, there have indeed been incidents and allegations that could be perceived as ""sleaze"" within the Conservative Party. These range from individual misconduct by MPs to broader questions about lobbying and the influence of money in politics. However, it's also crucial to recognize that the political landscape is complex and often more nuanced than the binary of sleaze or no sleaze.

As a historian, I would argue that while there are certainly elements within the Conservative Party that might warrant the label of sleaze, it is also a reflection of broader societal issues that transcend party lines.

It does matter, of course, it would be better if it were sooner, but because they set the target they are going to develop towards it. We run into two problems. One is that the developing world is not going to wish to give up growth that the developed world has enjoyed. So we have to find some way of handling that. An example is the disappointing statement by Indonesia on deforestation, where it said it would be unfair to expect us to keep to these limits. When rich countries have developed so fast, why should they limit themselves? So it may be the West has to spend more money to assist those countries to go to net zero. The second problem we come up against is internal. It is to do the cost of us at home of going green. It was notable that Joe Biden is trying to persuade OPEC to increase production of oil. That's not a good look. There is currently a gulf, a gap between our ambition of where we want to be in Britain and where the technology is. It's not there yet. It has not been developed, it is not quite cheap enough. How do we meet that gap between our ambition and where the technology is? The reality, I expect, is it a reduction in individual consumption and spending a lot more money through taxes, subsidies, increased prices, etcetera, etcetera. So I'm waiting for the moment when western governments are a little bit more honest with their public and say to them: If you really want to do this, we can do it, we're making progress, but it is going to cost the consumer a lot of money and it is going to require a change in lifestyle.

So it is all very well getting a heat pump, but if all the heat is going out the window anyway, we need to have both. Make sure homes are properly insulated, make sure we change the way in which we heat our homes. Quite frankly, I think it is a huge shame that over the last 10, 20 years there has been a change in policy, when I was in the department for energy and climate change, we had a policy of trying to make sure we insulated homes up and down the country. The government cut that scheme, introduced another one which has, frankly, been pathetic.We had a million homes built in the last few years that haven't been properly insulated. They will need to be retro fitted. So we need to be putting much more into heat pumps, of course we do, to make sure people can have them.

This comes back to my point about the gap between ambitions and where we are, the affordability. If we all tomorrow ran out and bought an electric car, which we couldn't afford to do, how would we charge them? We'd run it off the grid. If we all switched from petrol to electrification, where is that going to come from? So the infrastructure also has to catch up in order to match our ambitions.I'm not saying it can't be done because the point is in the long run, as has been said, you build a market for something so eventually, in theory, green technology could end up guaranteeing us not just abundant energy but also cheaper energy that's cleaner, cheaper than fossil fuels because it is on tap and it's renewable. So in the long run it will be great. But in the short term there is a cost. And it is to be borne by the consumer. I would remind people over the summer, before we even put our heating on, many people's -- my electric bill almost doubled. That's the cost that's going to be put on to the consumers.

Historically, major shifts in technology and infrastructure have often been underpinned by a combination of government incentive and innovation within the private sector. To make such transitions feasible for the average person, a similar approach is necessary today.

Governments can play a crucial role by offering subsidies or tax incentives for those investing in green technology. This not only makes it more affordable but also speeds up the adoption rate. On the other hand, as demand increases and technology advances, the cost of production for things like electric cars and heat pumps will decrease. This is a classic economic principle where scale can drive down prices.

Moreover, it's essential to consider the long-term savings associated with these technologies. While the upfront costs are indeed higher, the operational costs—be it through reduced energy bills or the lower maintenance requirements of electric vehicles—can offset the initial investment over time.

Ultimately, it's about creating a sustainable model that balances immediate economic challenges with long-term environmental and financial benefits.

Clearly, you do not put that cost on people who are unable to pay it. So when you go back to the discussion about the insulating your home or putting the heat pumps in your home, what the government should have put in the strategy was government money. Governments borrow pretty cheaply right now and it needs to invest in order to reap rewards afterwards.Someone mentioned COVID. If you look at how much the government has spent paying people to be on furlough, that's about 100 billion a year. That has put the economy on ice but it hasn't achieved anything very positive beyond making sure that people could keep going. If we put that money, that kind of money into the transition to a green economy, it would create many, many jobs. It would begin to pay for itself as those jobs raise the taxes that go back to the Treasury. We can do this. I think what is so frustrating, look at some of the countries in Europe who are already working out mass transit, public transport schemes, we should have a vision that isn't looking at petrol cars and thinking how do we replace all of those with electric cars because the building of cars is energy-intensive. We need more manualisation among public transport schemes. The person at the back was saying she would love to use the train but it is more expensive than flying. That is a policy choice the government made. It could make a different choice. It could tax the fuel domestically and make transport more affordable. We know how to do this stuff.

We're getting to that in 2024/25. 60 percent of the energy can now be done green at a cheaper cost than the fossil fuel if we just put the right policies in place. In the world we still have 500 billion against fossil fuel. Many governments have put more money to the fossil economy than to the green economy. It doesn't have to cost more money. That is just a fallacy. By the way, when we invented the light bulb, it didn't work right away either. When we invented the computer, it didn't last more than one minute, you had to recharge them.

We're doing this for climate justice, equity and respect.

We need a balanced approach that includes targeted restrictions, perhaps focused on the most vulnerable populations, while allowing the broader economy to continue functioning. This could be complemented by ramping up booster vaccinations, enforcing mask-wearing in crowded public spaces, and maintaining a robust test-and-trace system.

In the hypothetical scenario of an independent Scotland, I believe there must be a balance. The economy is crucial, of course—it sustains our livelihoods and ensures that we can provide for our families. However, the environment is our legacy. It's what we leave behind for our children and grandchildren. As someone who has seen the beauty of Scotland's landscapes and understands the potential consequences of environmental neglect, I'd argue that the environment should not play second fiddle to economic interests.

In dealing with the domestic oil industry, we'd need to think creatively and responsibly. Transitioning towards renewable energy sources while supporting the economy through this shift is vital. It's not just about choosing one over the other; it's about integrating both to work harmoniously. We must protect our beautiful country and ensure that its economy thrives—not just for us, but for future generations.

So to turn an issue of global cooperation and the eyes of the world being on Glasgow and the requirement for international leaders to work together, to challenge climate change, to do the very thing that Brian says we need to do, to confront the climate emergency and safe the planet. To reduce that to a conscious debate about Scotland's place in the UK, I think frankly misses the point. The reality is we have two failing governments in Scotland when it comes to climate change. We can't repeat the mistakes of the mining industry when entire communities were decimated and there wasn't a pathway to alternative employment. We can't make that same mistake in the North East.The UK government should be doing more in terms of that carbon capture project in the North East, but also the Scottish Government can be doing more. The Scottish Government promised that we would have 130,000 green jobs by 2020, and we've actually only created 21,400 green jobs in Scotland with the powers that we already have. So what we need to do is take the opportunity of COP26, when political leaders, both at home but abroad also, stop talking the rhetoric of climate change and actually turn it into meaningful action so we can change the planet. And that means leading by example.That means, when we're talking about integrated public transport, so we can get people that have gas guzzling vehicles, we don't cut routes in Scotland at the same time, meaning that our real workers are going to be going on strike in Glasgow at the very time when international eyes are on us. When we talked about protecting the global environment, it means not cutting the environmental budget here in Glasgow. Many of our cleansing workers are going to be going on strike during COP26.

The oil industry has been a significant part of Scotland's economy, but as we move towards our climate goals, we must shift our focus towards renewable energy sources. This transition must be managed carefully to support the workers and the economy. We need to invest in retraining programs and ensure that new, sustainable industries provide good-quality, unionized jobs.

So it's not an either/or, you have to have one and the other. And actually there are things that we could all do to make that happen, because we're not going to get a stronger environment by working out where the carbon capture goes or using another reusable coffee cup. What will really make the difference is massive innovation. And massive innovation does not happen. It's the kind of stuff that's going on in the labs of universities all over Scotland right now and it doesn't happen without somebody funding it.

One part I think is recognising that of course politics is going to have high emotions and of course there's a place for anger in politics as well. I think the challenge for all of us, though, is not to allow that anger and that emotion to turn into dislike and hatred. We all have very different political views on the stage,but that doesn't mean that we have to dislike each other or hate each other in the process. We can be very civil but still be angry and passionate about our politics.The further thing I would say is, we can't escape the fact that our public discourse and our political discourse also is part of the problem. Too much of our politics is about othering communities. It's about dehumanising other people, and it's about creating divisions amongst ourselves. And I think we've got to recognise that until we challenge that and we challenge the politics of anger with the politics of empathy, we challenge the politics and division with the politics of unity. And we challenge frankly the politics of despair that we feel as a society and a country with a politics of hope.

If the Scottish elections were to result in a government fully committed to independence, it certainly sends a strong signal about the will of the Scottish people at that time. However, the question of independence is not solely a matter of political mandate from one election. It's also a matter of legal and constitutional processes that bind the UK together.

The legal right of the Westminster government to deny another referendum is rooted in the fact that constitutional matters, including the union of the nations, are reserved to the UK Parliament. Morally, it's a bit more complex. If there is a sustained and clear desire for independence expressed through democratic means, such as elections, it would be morally challenging for Westminster to ignore this sentiment indefinitely.

However, any move towards another referendum should be made on the basis of broad consensus and clear evidence that independence is indeed the sustained will of the Scottish people, not just the result of one election. It's about ensuring that such a significant decision is made with the utmost consideration of all implications, both for Scotland and the rest of the UK.","Deborah Frances-White is a London-based comedian, author and screenwriter.

And very…you know, Rishi Sunak doesn’t say it on the telly but eight per cent cuts to public services. That is not recovery; that is grinding austerity, more grinding austerity.

It's about creating a sustainable economy that works for people and the planet, and ensuring our financial mechanisms support this vision without resorting to any sort of 'magic money tree'.","Liam James Halligan (born 29 April 1969) is a British economist, journalist, author and broadcaster.

Can you please each explain the key sources for the fund of the spending – do not involve a magic money tree.,"So, Scottish Conservatives are the only party in this election who, with our manifesto, published our full spending commitments. So, what we’re saying, for example, there’s £4.8 billion of unallocated capital spend in the Scottish government at the moment. We need to get that money out – so that drives our infrastructure growth right across the country, be it full fibre broadband, be it, you know, investing in more house building, the most ambitious social housing building programme since devolution that the Scottish Conservatives are putting forward.  And then we have said, only at the end of the parliament, if we can, you know, rebuild our education system by recruiting 3,000 additional teachers at a cost of £550 million over the course of the parliament, we would look to get parity back in the tax system, if it is possible. Because 1.1 million Scots currently pay more tax right now for doing the exact same job than elsewhere in the United Kingdom.","Douglas Gordon Ross (born 27 January 1983) is a Scottish politician who has served as Leader of the Scottish Conservative Party since 2020 and Leader of the Opposition in Scotland since 2021.

As Conservatives, we emphasize the importance of sound economic management and fiscal responsibility. Our approach is to stimulate economic growth through supportive policies for businesses and entrepreneurs, which in turn increases tax revenues without the need to raise tax rates. This growth-driven revenue is a cornerstone of our funding strategy.

Additionally, we look at re-prioritizing current spending, ensuring that government funds are used more efficiently and effectively. This means cutting down on wasteful expenditure and redirecting funds to priority areas like health, education, and infrastructure. It's not about finding new money, but using what we already have more wisely.

We also consider the role of private investment in public projects, leveraging private sector expertise and capital to deliver better services and infrastructure. This approach not only alleviates the financial burden on the taxpayer but also drives innovation and efficiency.

In summary, our funding sources are rooted in economic growth, prudent fiscal management, and strategic partnerships with the private sector. There's no need for fantastical sources of money; it's about making smarter choices with the resources we have.","Louise Margaret Haigh (/heɪɡ/) (born 22 July 1987) is a British politician serving as Shadow Secretary of State for Transport since 2021.

Firstly, our approach includes prudent fiscal management and prioritizing government spending to ensure that investments are made into sectors that will drive growth and generate revenue. This includes enhancing our capabilities in renewable energy, which Scotland is uniquely positioned to lead in, thus creating jobs and economic benefits.

Additionally, we aim to explore further revenue-generating measures such as progressive taxation where those with the broadest shoulders bear a fair share of the burden. This is not just about increasing taxes, but making the tax system more equitable and ensuring it supports public services and infrastructure that everyone benefits from.

We also look at maximizing the revenues from our natural resources responsibly and sustainably, ensuring that these benefits are felt across our communities. Moreover, improving tax collection and combating tax evasion are key components of our strategy to ensure that all due revenue is collected and used for public good.

Lastly, we are committed to exploring financial powers and mechanisms that allow for innovative funding of public projects, including bonds and other forms of investment that do not burden the taxpayer unduly but support long-term economic growth and stability.","Helen Olivia Bicknell Whately (née Lightwood; born 23 June 1976) is a British politician serving as Minister of State for Social Care since October 2022, and previously from 2020 to 2021.

And what we need to do is to use some of the new technologies and new ways of working that we’ve developed through the pandemic, to make sure that we can deal with this backlog as quickly as possible. We’ve got two and a half billion pounds of extra funding that’s going to be committed to the NHS over this period, and that means we’ll have the finance.But at the heart of this, we need to deal with the problem that pervades much of the public services, which is our mental health problem. We’re not training any more psychiatrists and psychologists than we did five years ago. We need to have mental health first-aiders in every single work place so we can reduce the demand on the NHS. We also need to make sure that we’re deploying the mental health counsellors that are in the community to be able to take the load off there as well. So, that will help significantly.
We also need to localise health services because people have got used to health services being much more local, whether it’s using the technology or in their local centre. We need to make sure that the specialists are available at a local level, again, to reduce the demand, to do the preventative work, so that we can actually get the NHS back on track. This has got to be one of our top priorities because we need to invest in our NHS to make sure people get the treatment that they need on time.","William Cowan Rennie (born 27 September 1967) is a Scottish politician who served as the Leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats from 2011 to 2021.

While the dedication of NHS staff is commendable and truly the backbone of our healthcare system, there are clear areas where more support is needed.

We must ensure that the NHS is not only adequately funded but also that resources are allocated efficiently to meet these specific challenges. This includes investing in more specialized facilities for rehabilitation and ensuring that our healthcare professionals have the training and tools they need to provide the best care possible. Additionally, mental health support, which will be crucial in COVID-19 recovery, needs significant enhancement.

As we move forward, it's also vital that we learn from this pandemic about how to better structure our health services to be more resilient and responsive to the needs of all patients.
